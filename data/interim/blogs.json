Does it take you 8 minutes and 3 life tokens to clear?\n* This beginner guide aims to take your time down to sub 2 minutes and potentially zero life tokens by showing you ways to increase critical chance, along with other tips to increase your damage while using my Male Mechanic as an example.\n  \nCritical Cap* Critical rate differs when in town and in dungeon. The best way to know your critical rate is to go to Training Center in Hendon Myre. Once in, just cast your buff still and see what the crit rate is.\n* For example: While in town, my crit rate is 76.6%. In training center, my crit rate is 96.6%. With my buff skill, it's 100.6%, which is plenty.\n* Refer to\u00a0this spreadsheet\u00a0to see where your class stands (credit to\u00a0u\/freecomkcf)\n\nWays to Hit Critical Cap* There are 4 equipment slots that can give you Critical Chance through enchantment: Head\/Shoulder, Beat, Shoes, and Sub Equipment. With proper Enchants, you can get up to 22% Critical Chance increase.\n\n* With new players, for Head\/Shoulder, Beat, Shoes I used Noblesky Green Bijou Bead\u00a0, which gives 5% magical crit chance for each slot (aka. +15%). For Sub Equipment, I used Noblesky Blue Bijou Bead\u00a0, which gives me 2% magical crit chance. So in total, I got 17% through enchants.\n* Avatars and Emblems are another great source of Crit Chance. Here you can get Crit from Red and Green Emblems. Below are my example:\n+ For Red Emblem slots, I used multi-colored Rare Red-Green (Int + Magic Cri)\u00a0. Each one gave me 1.1% crit. Therefore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are 4.4% Crit.\n+ For Green Emblem slots, I used Rare Green (Magic Cri)\u00a0. Each one gave me 2.2%. Therefore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are 8.8%. I used those rare green for the aura\u00a0\u00a0too, so that's another extra 4.4% for a total of 13.2%\n+ On top of that, the Aura itself\u00a0\u00a0gave me an extra 10%.\n\n* Other source you can look out for are Pet and Tittle. For my example, the Pet\u00a0\u00a0gave me 5%, and the Title\u00a0\u00a0gave me 3%.\n\nOther Damage Increase Tips* Use appropriate Enchants on other equipment slots. This part depends on the class you're playing. DFO classes can be divided into 4 damage categories:\n+ Fixed Physical - so look for Independent Att and\/or Strength cards\/beads\n+ Fixed Magical - so look for Independent Att and\/or Int cards\/beads\n+ Percent Physical - so look for Physical Weapon Att cards\/beads\n+ Percent Magical - so look for Magical Weapon Att cards\/beads\n\n* Really the easiest way to know which one is your class is though the\u00a0DFO class roles Excel Sheet. Here's an example of what I used for my Male Mechanic.\u00a0NOTE: Always use Elemental Damage when you can, those trump other damage type.\n+ Grim Seeker Fighter\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Weapon Magical Attack)\n+ Officer Mercel\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Elemental Damage)\n+ Hound Cyrus\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0(Elemental Damage)\n+ Anje Wane for\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0(All Stat)\n+ Heat Researcher Zadracon\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0(Elemental Damge)\n\n* For your convenience, I have indexed the recommended enchants for each equipment slots.\n* Reinforcement\/Refinement on weapon is another huge damage boost.\n+ For Percent Class, Reinforce the weapon (+10 should be enough)\n+ For Fixed Class, Refine the weapon (+6\/+7 should be enough)\n\n* Insignia\u00a0is another easy way.\n+ Fixed Physical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Punishment\n+ Fixed Magical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Spirit\n+ Percent Physical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Protection\n+ Percent Magical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Blessing\n\n* Gems\u00a0to go along with your insignia\n+ One\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(element type of your choice)\n+ One\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(physical\/magical crit)\n+ The other 2 slots can be whatever, usually hit rate and attack speed\n\n* Where can I get them?\u00a0The easiest way is to joint a guild, then you only need to log in weekly to get Guild Coin\u00a0. Then walk to the Guild Hideout, talk to the NPC to buy your goods.\n\n* Swap Set is also huge, NEVER forget about them. You can get your set from Operation: Hope dungeon. You can read more in this\u00a0Swap Set: The Essential Tool for Damage\u00a0post.\n* Cube contract is absolutely a must. You need to make your weapon inflict an element to DO elemental damage and Level 100 legendary\/unique weapon can't do that. Therefore you will need\u00a0, which can be bought with gold in Cera shop (500,000\u00a0\u00a0for 7 days).\n+ Once you get the contract, you can select the type of element inflict you want by clicking on the cube in your \"Material\" tab in your inventory. When you see a color cube at the bottom, you're good to go.\n\n* Automated Player Characters (APCs) is one of the last resort if you really need to. These are synergy classes that can give you damage boost. They're very cheap and can be\u00a0bought from auction hall. The common ones are Number 28\u00a0\u00a0and Soldoros\u00a0.\n\n  \nChangelog* 10\/1\/2021: Reworked this page to include more explanations than just bullet points.\n\n\n","13":"\n\n\n\n\nDungeon\ngrakkarak.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

The webstore version does NOT give you the coin like the previous package. So now the only way you can get the coin is to by the $40 version.\n+ The aura is pretty much best in slot but requires 3 coins (aka $120) to upgrade.\n\n+ Regardless, the female gunner hair is super nice.

I think the genre of action games is different from the hack and slash genre.\n+ If hack and slash is a pleasant way to sweep away monsters, action game is suppose to use the right skills at the right time, focusing on the battle with the monsters, and to lead the battle advantageously by avoiding or destroying the pattern in an appropriate way when a dangerous situation comes.\n+ In recent years, Dungeon & Fighter has been continuously maintained without any major changes or challenges in terms of system or gameplay. As a result, I felt like the fun in the game was diminishing little by little.\n+ If we focus only on creating content in the same way as before, we could have released more content at a faster time, but it is too old to keep piling up the same things, so repeating the same actions no longer makes sense. Before, I thought I had to try new things.\n+ Since we thought that it was impossible to simply add one or two systems or dungeons to try these changes, we integrated and added related systems while expanding the max level.\n+ Of course, some people will find it difficult to make a sudden change, and some would like to start with a small change. We ourselves had a lot of such concerns and worries. And even now, I still have a lot of fear of change, but nevertheless, I decided that it would be more efficient to carry out overall innovation in line with the opportunity for max level expansion than to proceed while modifying the past one by one. I thought it would be more comfortable for adventurers to adapt.\n\n* Of course, forcing too big a change on you is also not a desirable direction, so we tried to make it possible for those who want to play similar to the previous one to enjoy DnF without major changes.\n+ For example, elements that are helpful for dungeon capture, such as the neutralization gauge and enhanced backstep skill, have been added, but don't worry too much about those elements, and you will not have any problems dealing with monsters in the same way as before.\n\n* To recap, I can say that there are two things that I thought most important this time. The first is the action, the second is the equipment.\n+ The biggest direction of the action is that it is about to start a change from the existing hack and slash genre of killing monsters with powerful skills to a direction that strengthens the action, which places importance on fighting with monsters.\n+ Accordingly, it was thought that the character could be adjusted accordingly by reducing the monster's harshness first, and the monster's attack power that ignores the character's defense was deleted. After deleting all of them, those patterns were changed to be used only partially in essential situations.\n+ Second, to talk about the equipment, the existing equipment up to level 100 had their own characteristics but basically the equipment has a lot of similar options. I thought that the playstyle that was too uniform without any character distinction.\n+ Although the damage is a bit lacking, there are equipment that you can play without thinking much, while there are settings that can create more powerful damage even if you embrace some penalties. we hope that adventurers will be able to enjoy the game in a way that they find enjoyable.\n+ And since all of these equipment shouldn't be swayed too much by RNG, we've increased the drop rate of epic gear significantly more than before.\n\n* So, in the 105 gear situation, I think it will be a time when balance becomes more important than ever, and I will continue to do my best to update balance. The direction of action and equipment mentioned above is expected to create a very big change that encompasses the game as a whole.\n+ We made efforts to lower the play hurdles by strengthening the in-game guide, but nevertheless, as I said at the last festival, in the case of this max level expansion, we are prepared to have more modifications.\n+ If there is still an excessively i-frame or unreasonable pattern, or if you have equipment with a strange balance, there is a high probability that we missed it because there are too many things to worry about. If you do, we will always keep our eyes and ears open, so please let us know. We will continue to do our best to improve the game.\n\n* After a long period of preparation for the update, it is finally available to adventurers, but I can't guarantee that this update will be a success. The evaluation is not made by us, but by the players. However, after time has passed, this level cap was a necessary update to walk on the right path to make Dungeon & Fighter more interesting in the future.\n\nReferencesDirector's Note  \n\n\n","43":"\n\n* DFO ExStream is a traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (Mar. 22nd).\n\nContent* Part 2 of\u00a0DFOG 7th Anniversary.

So this ExStream Duni and Tigger was free-styling.\n* Do you think the raids cap can be 1x per week but double the rewards. There is so much to do throughout the week and raid trains can take up a lot of time?\n+ This is a big raid content that they can't make comment at this moment, but can bring it up in meeting.\n\n* Are you going to provide support for DFO on Steam Deck (not through Steam)?\n+ Uhm, no one has asked that. Valid question, they will bring it up. But as for right now, nothing planned.\n\n* For the elven tales event, will you only have one chance each day to get the daily rewards? or can you can do it numerous times and gain more leaves?\n+ Yes, chance of getting reward remains same.\n\n* Will there be DNF duel rewards that translate to DFO?\n+ Doubt it.\n\n* Assault next week?\n+ Haha, did you even watch our Stream? Anyway, he's on the horizon.\n\n* Police avatars please?\n+ Maybe it's okay to bring it up again now.\n\n* There's a bug with binding multiple skills to the same command. It doesn't work unless you manually rebind them every time you log in.

What about starting from scratch? No worries, I'll explain this level expansion for you.\n* Before we get to progression, it's important that you understand how the gear meta have changed and how these 240+ new epics works. Below is my plan of progression when 110 cap hit DFOG. If you see any error, let me know.\n* To read detail info about this cap, see this\u00a0Season 8: The Next Journey\u00a0post.\n\nTable of Contents* 110 Cap Summarized\n+ New Meta\n+ \"New\" Way to Get Epics\n+ How 105 Epic are Organized\n\n* How Do I Progress Now\n+ Start From Scratch\n+ Start as 100 Cap Graduate\n+ Start at Guide of Wisdom Graduate\n+ Final Milestones\n+ Some Final Info\n\n* References\n\n\n\nNew Meta* In previous level cap, all new epic equipment have a fixed stat. Whatever you get from dungeon and raids are that stat you're stuck with.\n* In level 100 cap, you get to use Raid epic gear such as Sirocco and Ozma pieces to fuse with your current gear, thus giving you more damage. But at the end of the day, whatever piece you fused, that stat doesn't change.\n* Until now, in level 110 Cap. These new epics can now levelled up and that piece will give you more stat. Along side what, damage mods (e.g. PMI, Bonus damage, Critical damage, etc.) are now merged into one called Damage Amplification.\n* In the picture below, you can feed un-used epic to your main piece to level it up. It doesn't even have to be a duplicate, any piece of the same slot will work.\n\n  \n\n\n\"New\" Way to Get Epics* This is not really new because we have seen this method before with the Spectre release.\n* Basically Spectre class had her own event dungeon. Here each of these sub event dungeons can drop epics at an insane rate, even mini-boss can drop level 100 epics. If you don't remember, there was even a website that guide you which dungeon drop which piece.\n\n* Now apply that to level 110 cap, it's every similar, all 10 new dungeons (Normal and Advance) can drop epic at any difficulty.\n\n* For the 8 normal dungeons, you now have 8 difficulties (Normal \u2192 King, then Heroes Normal \u2192 Heroes King). Each difficulty is progressively harder and requires more Adventure Fame to enter.\n* Well, Raven, if all of them drop epic, why do I need to clear harder difficulties?\n+ Higher difficulties will still have the same drop pool, but the Growth level of those epic will be higher. Therefore, for example, instead of getting level 2 Growth level epic, you get level 25 Growth level, that would save you time and materials to level it up.\n\n* Well, Raven, how do I know which of these 10 dungeon I should farm? I'll get to that.\n\n\n\nHow 105 Epic are Organized* Even though there are no set piece in 110 cap, all 240+ of them can be organized in 2 major categories: Fixed Option and Custom Option\n+ Fixed Option can further be sub-categorized as Normal and Advanced.\n\n* For your convenience, I have prepared this\u00a0Spreadsheet\u00a0so you can read about those epic.\n* Fixed Option Epics:\n+ When looking at the Spreadsheet, you will see that each item will have 4 Options, and those are for the most part unique to that pieces.\n+ You can have multiple pieces that can favor a specific build (e.g. Bleeding built, X-string built, etc) to your liking. That's why this 110 cap is so versatile.\n\n* Advanced Fixed Option Epics:\n+ These are still for the most part unique in their options but a bit more OP, and they can only drop from from Advance dungeons (Noblesse Code, Destroyed Castle of the Dead, and Meister's Laboratory).\n+ They are not necessary 2 or 3 times stronger than normal Fix-Option epics. You need to read their options and see which one worth swapping over.\n+ For example:\u00a0Tactical Drone Controller Armlet\u00a0, one single option increases Damage Amplification by 356 AND stacks up to 10. Granted it decreases your movement speed by a bunch, so use at your own risk.\n\nCustom Option Epics* These are unique in a way is that their Options are not pre-determined like Fixed Option. Rather when they drop, they get 4 out of a pool of options.\n* KDnF has a tier list of those custom option as well, but I'll let you judge for yourself which one you want. For example, \"Crit chance +5%\" option is pretty trash, duh.\n* Another perk is that you get to pick one of the 4 random option and change it. When a gear\u2019s option is replaced this way, the gear can no longer have its options replaced except for the option that was changed.\n+ In the left picture below, since this is a clean piece, you can pick any option to change. However, in the right picture, this piece already have option 1 changed, therefore, option 1 is the only one available to change again.\n\n* Replaceable options will be marked with yellow arrows next to them. Left pic is a clean piece, where as right pic has its Option 1 modified.\n\n* Where can you get these custom epic? Only from Normal dungeon at Hero difficulties and Advance dungeons at Expert difficulty or higher. Each slot has 3 possible custom epics and they're dropped in specific dungeons.\n* So What is the Point of Custom Option Epic?\n+ The main point is to reinforce a certain build (e.g. \"If 40% or lower HP, Skill Atk. +8%\" option when using\u00a0Suppressed Mana Bracelet\u00a0\u00a0piece). The possibility is endless. If you don't have a specific build, generic skill attack options are good too (e.g.\u00a0All lvl x skill atk +20%)\n\n* To learn more about this topic, visit this\u00a0Custom Epic Made Simple\u00a0post.\n\nWhat About Legendary Gear* You read that right, 110 cap also have Legendary Gear. But from what I have read, they're not really used to bridge your way to epic gear.\n* They are kinda the other way around. Legendary Gear can only be obtained in Advanced Dungeons Expert difficulty or higher. And they're tradable.\n* The main point of them is that their options are better than Normal Fixed Option epic. AND their option can also be transferred to Custom Option Epics.\n* So in a way, I guess if you don't have a good option to transfer, you can buy a legendary and transfer an option from there.\n\n\nHow Do I Progress Now\n\nStart From Scratch* This apply for players that have taken a long hiatus. Maybe you left at 86 cap and start to come back. Or maybe you leveling fresh character. This part is for you.\n* Start at normal dungeon difficulty Normal or Expert. They don't require a lot of Fame to enter.\n* Clearing those dungeons at Normal difficulty will give you entry level materials called\u00a0\u00a0Frost Crystal Fragments and its account bound version.\n+ If you don't already have some epic pieces, use these\u00a0\u00a0to start buying unique gears from NPC shop. Moreover, use these entry materials to start buying your basic enchants as well.\n+ Also don't forget to buy your Abyss swap set. I made a post about it a while ago, check it out.\n* Level 110 Normal dungeons at all difficulty also drop the next tier materials called\u00a0\u00a0Ominous Crystals\u00a0and its account bound version.\n+ Their main purpose is for purchasing Selective Level 105 Fixed Option epic box. Yes, if you don't get the piece you want, you can just trade\u00a0\u00a0for it. Getting epic at this cap is that easy. Each box cost 1,527\u00a0.\n+ Pro Tip: You can get more of these via daily mission. AND daily mission can be done PER CHARACTER. As you can see, the more alt you clear daily mission, the more\u00a0\u00a0you can funnel to your mains.\n\n  \n* Your next goal is to get enough fame to enter Advance dungeon (Noblesse Code and Destroyed Castle of the Dead)\n+ Normal dungeon Hero difficulty start at\u00a025,837\u00a0fame, where as Noblesse Code normal difficulty start at\u00a016,880 fame.\n+ Getting to 16,880 fame shouldn't be hard in this cap. So if you have 4 characters, I highly recommend you start doing Noblesse Code normal mode. Not only do they drop lot of epics, but you can pick and choose which piece to give to which alt. Thus gearing up multiple characters at the same time.\n+ These advance dungeons will drop the next tier materials called\u00a0\u00a0Red Dusk Crystals\u00a0and its account bound version. You can use this\u00a0\u00a0to buy Fixed Option Epic Selection box. This one is different than the one you buy with\u00a0\u00a0in a way that it include epics that drop from Noblesse Code and Destroyed Castle of the Dead (aka Advanced Fix Option Epics)\n\n* Your next goal here is to level up your epics and get to 25,837 fame. Looking at the table below, getting that fame will grant you access to Hero difficulty and Advance dungeon Expert.\n\n\n\n| Normal Dungeons | Noblesse Code | Destroyed Castle of the Dead |\n| King 21,675 | Normal 16,880 | Normal 17,612 |\n| Slayer 23,259 | Expert 23,788 | Expert 24,472 |\n| Hero Normal 25,837 | Master 27,483 | Master 30,267 |\n| Hero Expert 29,369 |  |  |\n| Hero Master 30,946 |  |  |\n| Hero King 32,523 |  |  |\n| Hero Slayer 33,989 |  |  |\n\n+ This is pretty much your end game farming (for now). These difficulties will start dropping Custom Option Epics to complement with your current set. This part is also pretty much lots of RNG. There is a big pool of custom option, so you don't always get the top tier options.\n+ At this high level difficulty is where you start seeing another tier material called\u00a0\u00a0Harmony Crystal. This is used to safely amp your gear where if you fail, the amp level doesn't decrease. You can read more about it here.\n+ A side content you should be doing around this progression is Storm's Wrath. This is a weekly dungeon that can drop epic with option level 30~60 and only require 25,407 to enter Expert level. These option level will boost your fame tremendously.\n\n  \n\n\nStart as 100 Cap Graduate* This part kind of depends on how strong and how many fame you have.\n* If you're a whale with 17-18k fame with full Sirocco, Ozma, and BP gear. You can go straight to Destroyed Castle of the Dead Normal mode. Here's an example of 18.5k Male Nen clearing Normal Destroyed Castle of the Dead.\n\n  \n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \n* Along side with Normal mode Advance dungeon, do normal dungeons at the highest difficulty you can to start gathering your 105 epics.\n* If you don't have enough fame, myself for example, my main is at 16,101 fame. With the mythic reworks, I probably would have a bit higher fame. Normal Castle needs 17,612 fame, so I would start at normal dungeons Master difficulty (requires 13,195 fame).\n* Then try to make your way to 25,837\u00a0fame for those higher level dungeons to get Custom Option Epics.\n* You can also feed your Ozma fused gear, Sirocco Fused gear, and Max BP gear to 105 epic.\n\n\n\nStart at Guide of Wisdom Graduate* This would apply to a lot of my lower tier alts. Those are the character at about 12-13k fame.\n* Here you're probably strong enough to solo Oculus party mode or enough to get to Sirocco green party.\n* Here I would start with Normal dungeon Master difficulty if you have enough fame. If not, then start at Expert difficulty. Then follow the normal route mentioned above.\n\n\n\nFinal Milestones* Hitting 33,043 Fame grants you access to the first Legion dungeon, Ispins. This dungeon drop option level 50~70, which can help boost you fame.\n+ This is the area where you acquire\u00a0\u00a0Quad-Color Split Energy for your fusion epics\u00a0for your Accessory slots.\n+ Every dragon you kill here will give you 1 Tales of Bravery which can be converted into Conqueror's Token and used to buy various goods from NPC Flo. Some good items includes +30 Elemental damage Magic Stone Bead and Ispins Fixed-option epics.\n\n* Hitting 34,308 Fame grants you access to Machine's Revolution: Total War.\u00a0This dungeon drop option level 60~65, which can help boost you fame.\n+ This is the area where you acquire\u00a0\u00a0Cruel King of Dragons' Seal for your\u00a0fusion epics\u00a0for your Armor slots.\n+ Here you will get another version Tales of Bravery which can be converted into Conqueror's Token and used to buy various goods from\u00a0NPC Flo. Some good items includes Warped Dimension Cube and Total War Fixed-option epics.\n  \n  \n\n\nSome Final Info* Golden Beryl\u00a0is another materials used for option growth, transfer and level transfer of epics. They can drop at any normal dungeon difficulty. However, the tradable version\u00a0\u00a0Flawless Golden Beryl only drops in Advance dungeons.\n* Level 110 cap comes with a Revamped Encyclopedia. Make sure to use it to look up where to get each epic piece.\n+ From a quick glance,\u00a0Vericollis Temple drops lots of Accessories and Special Equipment. Whereas\u00a0Nasau Forest drops a lot more armor pieces.\n\n* Advance dungeons require Entry Ticket and FP to enter. These Tickets require Play Points\u00a0to buy. You get 1 Play Point for every 30 FP spent. So it's in your best interest to burn all FP everyday. If I don't have time to play that day, I would use FP Express to burn them off in normal dungeons. Those ticket don't expire, so stock them up on your busy day then use them on your free day.\n+ With the\u00a0The Meister's Laboratory\u00a0update, you no longer get Play Point from spending FP . Instead you get 10 Points from completing daily limited mission.\n\n* Keep your 100 cap Mythic. They got revamped and got a huge Fame boost. You can still use them for a while before being replaced with good Custom-Option epics.\nCongrats* You have reached the end of this progression guide. Really at the end of the day, it depends on your fame. You now know the general path. Now pick the appropriate dungeon difficult.\n\n\nReferences105 Epic Farming Guide!  \nChangelog  \n* 3\/26\/2023: Added some final milestones.\n* 7\/12\/2022: Apparently you will need to clear the optimal dungeon to get the play point\n* 5\/1\/2022: Adjusted fame requirements for various dungeon difficulties.\n* 4\/11\/2022: Add some clarification on Advanced Fix-Option Epics.

It is placed in Elvenguard at the starting area so that new\/returning adventurers can access even low level. It's not a long story, but I would appreciate it if you watch it and enjoy it as a small story that is connected to the previously revealed Grim Seeker story.\n* New area Elvenmere added where you're heading down to Hendon Myre.\n\n* This is a dungeon that does not consume fatigue, clear cubes, and equipment durability.\n* All stages of the dungeon can be cleared once a week, and all accounts share the clear status. For example, you can clear Steps 1~24 as Character A \u2192 When connecting as Character B, you can play from Step 25.\n+ The appropriate level for Elvenmere to play is level 17 to 110, and you can freely select and enter the 4 allocated areas. (However, you cannot receive rewards for uncleared stages.)\n\n* A certain amount of HP\/MP\/skill cooldown is restored every time you clear each stage.\n* The last stage of each realm will have a boss monster. Defeat it to go to the next realm.\n* Hidden monsters appear with a certain probability at each stage and drop the \"Leaf Coin\" that can be used in the Elvenmere shop.\n+ If you move to the next stage without acquiring the dropped item, the item will also be moved.\n+ The stage where the hidden monster appears changes every week.\n\n\n\nDungeon Plays* Elvenmere consists of 100 stages\n* At each stage, a background and play style suitable for the level appears, and you can enter the next stage by defeating the boss monster.\n+ Normal Style: General configuration steps similar to other dungeons. A type of dungeon where a certain amount of normal \/ named monsters appear and clear the boss.\n+ Hack and Slash Style: A stage in which a large number of normal \/ named monsters appear at regular intervals. More monsters appear than other styles.\n+ Great Battle Style: Steps to battle with a small number of monsters. Battle with named and boss monsters.\n+ Arcade Scroll Style:\u00a0Arcade scrolling stages similar to Operation Hope.\n\n* As the level increases, the level and difficulty of the monster increases.\n* If you stay within a stage for more than a certain period of time, the illusion becomes stronger, and accordingly, the effect that makes the monster in the stage become stronger and obstacles that interfere with the adventurer appear.\n\n\n\nRewards* Elvenmere rewards are given every time you clear a stage, and consist of seasonal rewards and weekly rewards.\n* Season rewards (Accound-bound):\n+ Season rewards are given at certain stages, and are provided when you clear the stage for the first time.\n+ Season rewards cannot be acquired again until the season reset.\n+ The season reset schedule will be notified in advance before the end of the season.\n\n\n\n| Stage | Icon | Item |\n| 5 |  | 3 Life Token Box |\n| 10 |  | Master Contract Package 3 Days\u200b |\n| 15 |  | Level 25 Relic Armor Set Selection Box |\n| 20 |  | Level 30 Relic Accessory Set Box |\n| 25 |  | 5 Town Movement Speed Potions+60% Town Movement Speed For 600 Seconds. |\n| 30 |  | 5 Life Token Box |\n| 35 |  | 30 Remy's Sparkling Touch Box |\n| 40 | \u200b | Level 50 Epic Accessory Box |\n| 45 | \u200b | Ring Of Combat Clear Ticket & Level 60 Epic Armor Selection Box |\n| 50 | \u200b\u200b | Sub Equipment Quest Clear Ticket & Level 60 Epic Sub Equipment Box |\n| 55 | \u200b | Magic Stone Quest Clear Ticket & Level 65 Epic Magic Stone Box |\n| 60 |  | Level 70 Epic Armor Set Selection Box |\n| 65 |  | Level 75 Epic Special Equipment Box |\n| 70 |  | Level 80 Epic Armor Set Selection Box |\n| 75 |  | Cube's Contract 7 Days & Level 80 Epic Armor Set Selection Box |\n| 80 |  | Earring Quest Clear Ticket & Level 90 Epic Armor Selection Box |\n| 85 | \u200b | Level 90 Epic Accessory Box & Level 90 Epic Special Equipment Box |\n| 90 |  | Inventory ExpansionExpands All Tabs In The Inventory By 8 Spaces |\n| 95 |  | Silver Vault Upgrade Kit |\n| 100 |  | Illusion Conquest Title Box |\n\n* Weekly rewards:\n+ The weekly rewards will reset weekly, and can be obtained by playing Elvenmere dungeon again.\n+ You can use \"Leaf Coin\" to purchase the following item from the shop.\n\n* Revolution Weapon Selection Box (Untradable):\n+ A box that can be obtained by selecting a Revolution weapon.

However, if multi-attribute switching is attempted within the dungeon, unexpected settings may be affected, so a limit on the number of times has been applied.\n\n* Cube's contract is immediately re-applied when resurrected after death in the dungeon\n* Level 95 equipment is changed to be able to be engraved directly on level 105 equipment.\n+ The cost is the same as engraving from level 95 to level 100 equipment and then to level 105 equipment.\n* Effect is added when you acquire the equipment you favorited from the equipment dictionary. Limited to Epic and Mythic equipment.\n\n* When searching for an item, materials and parts other than the item name are also changed to be searchable. Example: When searching for shoulders, items with shoulder in the item name and head\/shoulder slot are searched together.\n\n* A function to receive a selection box in bulk is added.\n+ You can receive up to 100 batches at once.\n+ If the items that can be selected from the box include equipment, avatars, creatures, insignia, talismans, and titles, the function is not applied.\n\n* Changed so that growth capsules\/skill level capsules\/coins can be used collectively by right-clicking shift.\n* When repurchasing an entry ticket item, the player's fame is not checked.\n* A warning message is added if there is an enchantment to be deleted on the equipment to be engraved.\n* Power Essence will be added to the 'Holy Grail of Faith ' shop next to NPC Magar Rosenbach.\n\n\n\nSystem Changes* A function to check fatigue level in the character selection window has been added. The basic fatigue and the PC room fatigue level are displayed separately, and the remaining fatigue level is displayed.\n* Batch sales function will be added to Delilah Shop. The skill registered to the \"Shift\" key and \"A\" key will not be used while the Delilla Shop is open.\n\n* Added ability to set saturation in graphic settings\n\n* A dismantling machine repair function has been added to the profession \/ dismantling menu\n\n* Monster Encyclopedia has been added to the ESC menu\n\n* Changed so that you can check the mission details in the dungeon.

Applies when the skill cooldown time display option is checked.\n\n* Town character masking function is added.\n+ This function reduces memory usage by limiting the appearance of overlapping characters while in town.\n+ In the case of friends, adventure team friends, and guild members, they are displayed regardless of the option.\n+ This function was added to alleviate lag when adventurers are crowded at the entrance of the dungeon.\n\n* The material change menu has been added to the Loton NPC menu.\n* The ability to add and edit the portal slot on the right side of the Seria room is added.\n+ Added slots: \"Equipment Upgrade\" will move in front of\u00a0 Kiri NPC. \"Profession\" will move in front of Abello NPC.\n+ Added editing function: You can edit the warp slots using the settings button.\n\n* The ability to view the equipment and fame of other characters in the reward result window that appears after clearing or failing the Noblesse Code has been added.\n\n  \n\n\n105 Epic Balance* Dev's Note: As mentioned before, we have downgraded the performance of level 105 epic items related to basic options. However, we tried to avoid changing the settings as much as possible due to this adjustment, so the setting was intended to be at a level that could still be considered in options with other settings. And we made adjustments to items that were judged to need additional adjustments.\n+ First, we have relaxed the condition of the recovery option due to the combo conditional or multi-hit so that the character centered on single-hit mechanic does not suffer as much.\n+ In the process, we have determined that the \"Necklace Of Exalted Fury\"\u00a0\u00a0and some custom epic options are over-balanced, so we have slightly lowered the figures.\n+ If all items are upgraded to match excessive performance, new settings will be created in the process, which can be a burden on adventurers, so we want to keep the changes within a stable range as much as possible.\n+ In addition, only items that were judged to require some upgrades were upgraded, and for equipment with excessive conditions and penalties, conditions and penalties were alleviated to enable smoother use.\n+ Lastly, due to the nature of the damage increase option, in order to alleviate the negative play feeling of damage increase getting lower as the option level increases, a skill attack increase option that is applied from a certain option level or higher has been added.\n\n* All changes are highlighted in

options are adjusted.\n+ Since the 3rd and 4th options of all fixed option epic equipment are designed to use the custom option as it is, adjusting the custom option causes the performance of the fixed option epic equipment to change in the same way.\n+ However, it is not intended to change the performance of the fixed option epic equipment, so we have adjusted the option values \u200b\u200bto have the same effect as the existing specifications as much as possible.\n+ This was adjusted for the same purpose for some equipment, such as the 'Knight's Pride' item reflected in the existing first

It was necessary to respond to various issues that occurred after the max level expansion, and to improve convenience that was not taken care of in advance.\n* After a meeting with the staff, while chatting, I heard the words, \u201cI am busy working for the max level expansion, so I can\u2019t do it on weekdays, and I don\u2019t have time to do housework on the weekends because I am busy.\u201d I was proud and saddened by the development staff who continued to work hard after the update.\n* What is particularly encouraging is that not only those who have played DnF in the past, but also a lot of new\/returned adventurers. In addition, existing adventurers are also called Dunlin, and we are very grateful for the help and interest in the settlement of new\/returned adventurers.\n* We may not have been perfect, but we are really happy with the many people called Dunlin while producing content called Elvenmere that is about to be updated tomorrow, planning an event, organizing a package, preparing a convenience update, etc.\n* I think the part that had the biggest impact on adventurers was probably the item reorganization.\n* Among the various options for items, if not modified, there were some that would cause serious balance problems in the future, and some items that are expected to be highlighted according to the change of the future meta.\n* As I said at the last festival, even if you have a bit of a crazy time in the beginning of the cap, you should fix the items that cause serious balance problems in the future so that it will not negatively affect adventurers with other settings. Because of this, it was inevitable to proceed with revisions several times.\n* Even before the revision, there were adventurers who were satisfied with the options and had a lot of fun, so it seems that the unavoidable revision caused inconvenience and anxiety a lot. I apologize once again.\n* And after the item reorganization to be carried out tomorrow, we do not intend to proceed with the large-scale item modification similar to the previous one.\n\nFuture Direction* Also, there are a few things that are still under development and are under discussing.\n* It's about independent objects. From the past to the present, there has been a problem in that characters who mainly use independent objects do not receive the option of triggerable items properly.\n+ We don't know all the history of this, but if we simply modify it, the balance can be shifted, and problems such as huge lag can occur, so we are approaching it with caution, but we are currently working hard to improve it.\n+ In the near future, we will accelerate the pace of development so that we can introduce it to adventurers through related patch notes.\n\n* We are also carefully reviewing your comments on the difficulty of dungeons.\n+ It requires some combination of settings as well as acquiring certain epic equipment to go from expert to master.\n+ We plan to lower the Master Difficulty and King Difficulty so that you can move up to the upper level more smoothly. So we're trying to alleviate some of that problem.\n+ We plan to maintain the gap between Normal and Heroes to some extent so that Heroes can become more challenging content.\n+ Master and King difficulty adjustments will be reflected immediately this week, but setting a new difficulty level will take a little longer.\n\n* In addition, problems such as incomplete settings, which are one of the other factors that increase the entry barrier for new characters or adventurers, will be continuously alleviated by adding helpful content, starting with Elvenmere, which will be updated this time. Please support this as well.\n* And, as previously mentioned, the new advanced dungeon, Meister's Lab, will be introduced through the first server in early May.\n+ We know that new dungeons, cool patterns, attractive monsters, and rewards or equipment that can be obtained are always a part of high expectations and interest, and we are doing our best to meet those expectations, especially this time at the max level. As adventurers received a lot of favorable reviews about the story through the expansion, we are working hard to create depth of fun in the story aspect as well.\n\n* Lastly, I was thinking about giving something to give as a token of appreciation for the fact that so many adventurers love and enjoy DnF. I've seen a lot of comments about the cute SD mask avatar that I recently gave as an event reward.\n+ So, I would like to proceed with the Spring Attendance Check event right away so that you can acquire the item once more. It was a decision I made hastily because I wanted to respond to the voice you give me, even a little, but I hope you like it.\n\n* I think it is really important to give you trust by showing how the parts I talked about in the developer notes, DnF Festival, or DnF ON are implemented step by step.\n+ Until now, except for some content that is judged to be better to be provided at a less burdensome time by adjusting the schedule, such as a creature reorganization, everyone is doing their best to keep the roadmap I mentioned earlier.\n+ We will do our best to repay you with higher quality by not repeating the disappointing parts in this max level expansion update, and continuing the popular parts.\n+ We would like to once again thank all adventurers who are always with us. Please give a lot of love and support to our development team, who are working hard day and night to make the most prosperous year even before the max level expansion.\n\nReferencesKDnF Director's Note  \n\n\n","61":"\n\n* Just a simple event.

You can click on the \"Buff Enhancement\" book, then register your swap gear.\n\n* How Does It Work?\n+ The swap set basically increases the level and stat of your buff skill (e.g.\u00a0).\n+ Back in the old days before this UI, you would have to equip the swap set, go into dungeon, cast you buff skill, then swap back into your damage gears. This Swap UI will do all that work for you.\n\nWhat Goes In the Swap UI?---Equipment---* The first pieces to the swap set that anyone can get are the equipment slots. These items are highlighted below and come from Operation: Hope dungeon.\n* This dungeon can be found in Closed Area in Harlem. Each character can enter it 3 times per week.\n\n* While running the dungeon, be sure to follow the path with the quest scroll (circled in red) because it will lead to you the area needed to complete the internal quest. By doing so you can get more\u00a0Abyss Fragment\u00a0\u00a0at the end.\n\n* can be used to buy swap set from NPC Ceberin. This is where you buy your weapon, armor, accessory, and special equipment pieces.\n\n* Weapon:\n+ There are 2 versions: regular and \"S\" version. The regular\u00a0can be upgraded to the \"S\" version, which give more stat. In the example below, the \"S\" version is about 4% stronger.\n\n+ To upgrade the weapon, you can buy the recipe from Ceberin. This recipe gives you an RNG chance of upgrading to \"S\". Cost 20\u00a0\u00a0and 100\u00a0\u00a0for each roll. Make sure you buy the correct recipe that matches your weapon type.\n\n+ Each fail attempt will give one\u00a0\u00a0. Basically 10\u00a0\u00a0will give guarantee \"S\" weapon using Conversion Scroll\u00a0.\n\n* Armor\u00a0and Accessory: Generic boxes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for all classes. When you open these boxes, the system will automatically select your class. So you don't have to worry about selecting the right one.\n* Special Equipment: This part is a bit more tricky. Here you have 3 options to pick\u00a0\u00a0Encroached set,\u00a0\u00a0Distorted set, and\u00a0\u00a0Warped set. Encroached gives you +3 level but offer minimal stat, whereas Warped gives +1 level but offer maximal stat. And Distorted is kind of in the middle. So you need to pick which one based on your budget.\n+ gives the most skill level but doesn't give any skill stat. You save money not to buy other skill level such as platinum emblem, title.\n+ gives the least skill level but most skill stat. You will need spend money on buying skill title and platinum emblem.\n+ What I recommend for new players is to pick Encroached set. Then as you get more in the end game and start to min-max, you can switch to Warped set.\n\n---Title---* Titles come in many shapes and sizes. Most buff swap titles add levels to your skill through 2 ways. (1) It straight adds level to the skill itself. (2) It adds level from the level range.\n* In the example below, this is a swap title for Mistress, whose buff skill is called \"Seven Deadly Sins\". Because this buff skill is a level 20 skill, when a Mistress uses this title, it will add 3 levels to her buff skill.\n\n* These swap titles usually come from seasonal packages and can cost quite a bit a gold to obtain, especially the price different between +2 and +3 title. Depends on the class, +2 title can cost you about 30 million gold, and +3 title can cost up to 70~80 million.\n* One of the beginner package from the webstore comes with a +2 title that may worth your money. If you don't want to spend cash, I would recommend waiting for the price on the auction hall to drop and maybe you get lucky and get something cheap within your budget.\n\n---Avatar---* This is where you can add up to 4 levels to the buff skill. 1 level from Rare Top, Rare Bottom, and Aura, with 1 level from the \"Ability\" section from Top avatar. Platinum emblems can be found in the Auction Hall and through Lost Treasure as\u00a0Selective Platinum Emblem Box.\n* Top & Bottom Avatars: Rare avatars (clone or non-clone) have slot to add platinum emblem onto them.\n* Aura: Only specific auras have plat emblem slot. So watch out for sales and packages from Neople.\n* In the example below, each plat emblem add 1 level to Male Ranger buff skill, Death by Revolver. With +1 from the \"Ability\" option in the Rare Top avatar, this set will give +4 level.\n\n---Creature---* Very similar to title, Pet can add level either straight up or through a skill level range. In the example below, Petite Ms. Black (left) adds level though level 15-35 range, whereas Petite Raven (right) adds level directly to the skill.\n\n* Again just like title, these pets often from from seasonal packages and sales, so watch out for them when they come around.\n\nExample Using My Male Ranger\n* NOTE: The MAX level you can add for non-sader classes is +10.\n* Equipment:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for armor and accessory,\u00a0\u00a0warped set for special equipment,\u00a0\u00a0\"S\" revolver.\n* Title: +2 from \"Awakened Ones All-in-One Package\" from the webstore.\n* Avatar: Rare top, bottom avatar with aura\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and 3 plat emblems\u00a0.\n* Creature:\u00a0\u00a0Petit Raven.\n* Total: +10 skill levels\n\nDo I Really Need Swap Set?* YES YES YES. Below is an example of 20-sec sandbag WITH swap set (57 Bil) vs. NO swap set (41 Bil).\n\nException to the Guide* Sader classes (Crusader, Seraph, Enchantress) are the exception. They don't use \"Operation: Hope\" gear and their max level to buff skill is +30 instead.\n* Generally speaking\n+ Swap gear is the one that give most stat and level to buff skill (e.g.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0)\n+ Actual gear is the one that give most level to 1st Awakening skill (e.g.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0)\n\n  \nChangelog* 9\/26\/2021: Reworked this page to include more explanation than just plain bullet points.\n\n\n","70":"\n\n\n\n\n\nTown\nwest\\_coast\\_alliance\\_camp.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n","71":"\n* Overview\n+ There are no new content updates with this patch\n\n* Events\n+ Honey Time\n+ Treasures of the Deep\n+ Where's Adventurer?\n\n* Sale\n+ Canna's Season 1 Limited Sales Shop\n\n* Comments\n+ IMPORTANT: Mileage reset on July 21\n+ Filler events until we get the next 3rd Awakening update.\n+ All events and safari package are set to end on July 21, which most likely the time when the next 3A is released.\n\n\n\n","72":"\n  \nNoticeThe author has requested peer review in the Male Launcher discord group\u00a0but couldn't get a review from anyone.

The main piece for this set up is\u00a0\u00a0Suppressed Mana Bracelet, which reduce your HP to 1% and allow incoming damage to consume MP instead of HP.\n+ To increase survivability, it's recommend to add\u00a0\u00a0Reversible Leather Coat and\u00a0\u00a0Accelerator to increase MP recovery.\n+ With new player, below is the recommendation for Normal Dungeon epic since you may not have enough\u00a0\u00a0Shattered Red Dusk Crystal yet.\n* Once you have enough\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shattered Red Dusk Crystal from Advance dungeon (e.g. Destroyed Castle of the Dead).

Don't forget that Total War patch also have some custom epic line changes.\n\n\n\n| \u00a0Ent Spirit Top(This\u00a0is mine now) | \u00a0Ent Spirit\u00a0Sub Equipment |\n| Must Have Line:If more than 40% HP, Physical\/Magical Def. +25,000 and Critical Chance -8%If 40% or lower HP, Skill Atk. +8%.

Black Shrine there was clearly the winner overall.\n* In this analysis, let's see how 400 runs of Black Shrine compare to 400 runs of Stormy Route.\n\nProcedure* The author had ran out of NeoPremium, with 156 fp plus pot, the author ran 20 runs on each character\u00a0 for easy calculation.\n* Repair cost was not included for the sake of consistency.\n\n* Gabriel Shop\n+ The author only bought items that are valuable for this analysis such as\n+ were not bought due to their minimal affect on this calculation.\n\n* No Purple Card Flip\n+ The author started doing no card flip midway through the analysis, so keep it that way for consistency.\n+ Realistically would be better if this card flip is included.\n\nTerminology* Total Raw Gold\u00a0- sum of\u00a0\u00a0from dungeon drops, card flips, selling white\/blue\/purple drops, and tradeable items such as\u00a0\u00a0, excluding card drops.\n* Time's Guide Stone Gold\u00a0- Theoretical cost of\u00a0\u00a0in term of character progression.\n* One Free Hell\u00a0- One Hell run after about 18 dungeon runs. It's the theoretical cost of 18\u00a0\u00a0in term of character progression.\n* Total Progression Gold\u00a0- The sum of all theoretical and raw golds (i.e. Total Raw Gold + Time's Guide Stone Gold + One Free Hell)\n* Jackpot\u00a0- An occurrence of \"Capricious Demon Prion\" aka this guy:\n\n  \nThe Data  \n  \n  \nDiscussion* Black Shrine\n+ Much easier to clear. 30 billion damage should have no problem clearing comfortably.\n+ Has chance of epic drop.\n+ Has chance of great card drop such as Ash Rosenberg\u00a0, Medium Airag\u00a0, Kazan-possessed Rosenberg\u00a0.\n+ Drop Time Crystal, which is one of the main source of income.\n\n* Stormy Route\n+ Much harder to clear comfortably.\n+ A lot of the bosses in this place can one shot you easily if don't one shot them first. There are also lots of annoying gimmicks suck as stun, freeze, I-frame. For example:\n- Evanescent Ferman\u00a0: Stun and I-frame\n- Hammer King Borodin\u00a0: Stun and I-frame\n- Guardian Rime\u00a0: Close to 100 % freeze with ice spike\n- Hyper Mecha Tau\u00a0: Stun and I-frame\n- Giant Nugol\u00a0: Bleeding\n- Pandemos Floo\u00a0: I-frame\n\n+ 35-40 billion damage is the cutline to clear.\n- 45-50 billion damage is recommended.\n- 30 billion damage is really pushing it, brave yourself to burn life tokens with that damage.\n\n* In Term of Raw Gold\n+ Stormy Route wins per average run.\n+ But you're looking at a 11.6% difference here.\n+ But keep in mind this is pre-Sirocco raid. Due to entry ticket costing 30\u00a0, the price may increase when the raid comes out.\n\n* In Term of Progression Gold\n+ Stormy Route wins with jackpots. Without jackpots, both dungeons are not far apart.\n+ You're looking at a higher gap of 36.3% here.\n\n* In Term of Efficiency\n+ The main argument here is that Black Shrine has epic drop as an advantage, but at the same time Stormy Route also drop more\u00a0, which translate to additional Guide of Wisdom runs, which require FP to run.\n+ Since level 100 epics are the main point of progression. The author will use epic chance per FP ratio as comparison\n+ If the epic drop chance is the same in 2+2, regular Black Shrine runs, and Guide of Wisdom (BIG\u00a0FAT\u00a0IF),\u00a0we all know it's not true, but for the shake of the analysis, the author will designate each epic chance as\n+ to\u00a0FP ratio\n- Black Shrine\n* Since Black Shrine builds up Guide of Wisdom gauge, 400 runs would give you 420\u00a0. Also technically speaking, the first 2 runs give double\u00a0, one from boss kill, one from card flip. So 400 runs will give 460\n* 400 runs yields 481\u00a0\u00a0and 116\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a033\n* 22,679,742 raw\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4 240\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a013\n* Total: 506\n* Total FP: 3,200 from 400 runs + 264 from 33\u00a0\u00a0+ 104 from 13\u00a0\u00a0= 3550\n* Grand Final: 0.14\u00a0\u00a0per FP\n\n- Stormy Route\n* 400 runs yields 1070\u00a0\u00a0and zero\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a059\n* 19,238,588 raw\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4 203\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a011\n* Total: 70\n* Total FP: 3,200 from 400 runs + 472 from 59\u00a0\u00a0+ 88 from 11\u00a0\u00a0= 3,760\n* Grand Final: 0.02\u00a0\u00a0per FP\n\n+ Black Shrine wins by the long shot with x7.66\u00a0 more efficient.\n\nRecommendation* If all you care about is raw gold, farm Stormy. Even though the raw gold is not far apart, with Sirocco raid coming soon, the price\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0will likely to increase. Stormy will give you more bang for your buck.\n* If all you care about is progression, still farm Stormy. It give you more progression in term of gold. HOWEVER, if you factor in RNG, Black Shrine is way more efficient in term of\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0FP ratio.\n\nTL;DR* Black Shrine is easier to clear, yield similar raw gold with great progression efficiency.\n* Stormy Route is harder to clear, yield slightly higher raw gold, higher gold progression but with terrible efficiency.\n  \n\n\n","80":"\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Dimension\ndark\\_dimension\\_erlox.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nDungeon\ndark\\_dimension.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nBoss\ndark\\_dimension\\_darkevil.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n","81":"\n\n* Ever looked into the 100 epic equipment and got overwhelmed?\n* Which one is the best in slot for my character?\n* What would be the best bang for your buck in term of damage increase?\n* This post provides general guidelines to help you with your gearing and spending decision in the end game.\n\nEquation For Basic Skill Damage* This Reddit page\u00a0explains clearly how damage is calculated but let's look at it in a simplest way possible.\n* This was was last edited 3 years ago, so it may be outdated, but this is the only equation the author can find.\n\nIf you get a critical hit, just take this and \u27161.5* Yellow\n+ \n+ Depends on if your character is percent damage or fixed damage.

The worst part is this system is required for endgame contents. Don't expect to get accepted into party if you don't have any talisman.\n\nHow Does This System Work?* This system is designed to customize and strengthen your skills.\n* You can open this system through the \"Talisman\" tab in the inventory window.\n\n* Upon opening the \"Talisman\" tab, you will see Picture 1. The green squares are for Talismans. The blue circles are for Runes. Clicking the Book (circled in red) will open up Picture 2 and 3. Picture 2 is the list of the current 5 talismans. Picture 3 will give all available runes.\n\n* So this system consists of 2 parts: Talismans and Runes.\n* Talismans:\n+ Currently with the Pandemonium War patch, there are 5 talismans for each class, and you can only equip 2 talismans. Korea added a 3rd slot with the \"Black Church\" update.\n+ Each talisman comes in 2 rarity: \"Rare\" and \"Unique\". You can read their descriptions and demonstrations in the section at the bottom.\n+ Each talisman also has 3 rune slots, and the colors are randomized between 5 colors. More info in the runes section below.\n+ Generally speaking, the best talisman would consist of Red, Blue, and Violet rune slots. This is where the RNG is worst. The talisman itself is RNG to get, and the rune slots are also RNG.\n\n* Runes:\n+ Looking at Picture 3, there are multiple skills that has runes.\n+ Each skill has 5 possible colors, and each color has 3 rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare):\n- Violet runes increase attack damage\n- Green runes reduce attack damage and also reduce cooldown\n- Blue runes only reduce cooldown\n- Yellow runes only increase range\n- Red runes increase attack damage and also increase cooldown\n\n+ Reading through each runes, the 3 most desired colors are\u00a0\u00a0for each talisman.\n\n* Example using male ranger:\n+ Two popular talismans for male ranger are\u00a0Acceleration Revolver and\u00a0Double Grinder.\n+ In Picture 4, you can see that the colors for those 2 talismans are not best-in-slot. The author has Blue Red for top talisman and Violet Red for bottom talisman.\n+ Upon equipping the appropriate color runes, the talismans will light up (Picture 5) and activate all their effects.\n+ The author picked\u00a0\u00a0runes because it's one of the highest DPS skill. Even then you could see that the author still has works to do because both Red runes and one Green rune are still at Uncommon rarity.\n\n  \nHow to Acquire Talismans and Runes* Talismans and runes are drops from Pandemonium War dungeon.\n* You need to be level 95 to access this content through its specific channel.\n\n  \n* There are plenty of guides out there explaining the mechanics. You can learn more through this\u00a0dungeon guide page.\n* Of course this dungeon drops talismans and runes among all kinds. So with the unwanted drops, you can use them for crafting other talismans and runes through \"Monica of the Library\" NPC.\n* The \"My Class\" option will only use talismans and runes specifically for your class. The author recommend only use this option if you have multiple duplicates or if you know for sure you don't use any of them.\n\n* Other ways to get talismans and runes include buying from mileage shop and explorer shop using Glory Crystals.\n\n  \n  \nThe Terrible RNG System  \n* To give you an idea of the RNG with this system, we need to see how big the drop pool is.\n* For Talismans:\n+ With 61 sub-classes and 5 talismans for each sub-class, there are 305 possible drops.\n+ Each talisman has 2 rarities, drop pool increased to 610.\n+ So the chance of drop for the desired Unique talisman from clearing Pandemonium War dungeon is 0.16%. AND that doesn't account for the combination of rune colors. 5 colors give 10 possible combination of 3-colors.\n+ Therefore, the chance of the desired drop is\u00a00.16%.\u00a0And when that drops, the chance of the best-in-slot color combination is\u00a010%.\n\n* For Runes:\n+ Each class has a set number of skill that have runes. Ranging from 9 skills (Female Nen) to 17 skills (Summoner).\n+ Using Female Nen as example: 9 skills, with 5 color runes, with 3 rune rarities give 135 drop pool.\n+ Even if we assume all 61 sub-classes have 9 skills, that still give a pool of\u00a08,235\u00a0possible drops.\n+ Therefore, without compounding, the chance of each desired rune is\u00a00.012%.\n+ Although clearing Challenge mode will drop about 25 runes, so that increase your chances a bit.\n\nDescriptions and Demonstrations for Each Talisman* You can access these information along with their popularity ranking through this\u00a0Talisman Archive\u00a0page.\n\n\n","87":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Female Fighter classes.

However, the author does have the EXP needed for lower levels and was able to find out a rough estimate of the EXP scaling.\n* Data sample:\n+ Challenger level 14 requires 1,731,676 EXP\n+ Challenger level 15 requires 1,800,943 EXP\n+ Challenger level 16 requires 1,872,981 EXP\n+ Challenger level 17 requires 1,947,900 EXP\n+ Challenger level 18 requires 2,025,816 EXP\n+ Challenger level 19 requires 2,106,849 EXP\nResult and Discussion* The author divided the EXP of one level to the previous level, the ratio turned out to be 1.04, which mean with each level, the EXP required will increase by 1.04\n* The author took this ratio and scale it up all the way to Savior level and got an estimate of the total EXP needed, however, there were some roadblocks. When comparing theoretical and actual EXP from the author's alts, the difference turned to be off by a few levels. For example:\n+ Expert level 33 should require 22,238,447 EXP, but the exact amount is 24,930,662 EXP (a.k.a. theoretical EXP required for level 36)\n+ Leader level 40 should require 171,196,329 EXP, but the exact amount is 224,182,043 EXP (a.k.a. theoretical EXP required for level 48)\n+ Guru level 16 should require 424,826,869 EXP, but the exact amount is 491,210,463 EXP (a.k.a theoretical EXP required for level 20)\n\n* When scaling up to Savior training and add them all together, the estimated cumulative EXP required turned out to be 2,485,533,761,335 EXP (that's 2.5 TRILLION). And with the roadblocks explained above, we know that we're at least underestimating this number. The author wouldn't be surprise if it turn out to be 3 trillion.\n\nHow Long Would it Take?* After running various level 100 cap dungeons, which require only 8 FP each, the author concluded that Ghent Palace Expert full clear yield the highest amount which is about 10.5 million EXP, not including EXP from each monster kill. Disaster Sector 3 also gives good EXP, but the it takes way too many FP to clear.\n* Assuming you have 156 FP bar, only 19 Ghent dungeons can be cleared in a day without using FP pot, which translate to roughly 34 years of clearing 19 Ghent Palace EVERYDAY.\n* AGAIN, between roadblocks and not including EXP from monster kills, we probably will still underestimate the result. How long does it actually take? looks like we'll never know.\n\nTL;DR* If you want to finish all the challenges from the character tab, you will need to get all 61 subclasses to Savior training, which will require you to clear 19 Ghent Palace Expert full runs on each of the 61 characters EVERYDAY for at least 34 years. If it takes 30 seconds to clear the dungeon, that's about 10 hours of playtime everyday for 34 years.\n* GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN!!!\n\nCredit* Thumbnail medal pictures credit to DFO Wiki\n\n  \n---EDIT Feb. 3rd, 2021---* The reason for the EXP discrepancy has been found.\n* In\u00a0this EXP sheet, it only has LEADER up to level 44, not 49 as indicated in DFO patch note.\n\n* And if you compare my alt in the image below, who is at Guru 17, the EXP match 100%.\n* Therefore, the error is that Neople claims the EXP level is changed to LEADER level 49, but in reality, it only scale up to LEADER level 44.\n\n\n","89":"\n\n* The goal of this article is to present all the information as effective as possible.

Instead of going deeper into the subconscious mind, you start from the deepest level and make your way up to \"Reality\" (aka defeat Sirocco)\n* New Special Function:\u00a0Trajectory of Nothingness (aka Bullet Time)\n+ Can only be used by party leaders\n+ When activate will slow down all enemies and their attacks.\n\n  \n\n\nRaid Layout* Phase 1: Sirocco Chase Operation-Lower Sky Castle\n+ You chase Sirocco from the bottom of the Sky Castle\n+ There are 4 floors:\n- Gateway of Laws\n- Gateway of Intelligence\n- Gateway of Trials I\n- Gateway of Trials II\n\n* Phase 2: Sirocco Subjugation Operation-Hall of Immateriality\n+ Think of it like reverse Inception\n+ There are 3 levels\n- Hall of Immateriality - The 3rd Plane\n- Hall of Immateriality - The 2nd Plane\n- Hall of Immateriality - The 1st Plane\n\n\n\n\u2b9cPhase 1\u2b9e\n\n\ud83d\udeaaFloor 1\/4: Gateway of Laws\ud83d\udeaa* 4 Destroyed Gate dungeons will spawn\n\n* The Gatekepper is the boss of the dungeons.\n* At each boss room, he will absorb a specific amount of souls, ranging from 1 to 4.\n* Your job is to communicate with each other and clear the dungeon in that specific order (1-2-3-4).\n* Upon clearing all 4 dungeons, the teams will advance to the next gateway\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udeaaFloor 2\/4: Gateway to Intelligence\ud83d\udeaa* 4 dungeons will spawn.\n* One party has to be actively fighting the boss in Dawn of Dreams before the other 3 dungeons are unlocked.\n* Upon clearing Dawn of Dreams,\u00a0the teams will advance to the next gateway.\n* As for the other three dungeons, clear or not clear each dungeon will inflict different effects.\n* Border of Phantasm:\n+ If you don't clear:\n- It spawns Camouflage in\u00a0Dawn of Dreams\n- It spawns Tornado in Night of Terrors\n- It reduces player's defense in Day of Return by 25% (up to 100%)\n\n+ If you clear:\n- Player damage in Dawn of Dreams increase by 100%\n- All gimmicks from Border of Phantasm\u00a0will reset\n\n* Night of Terrors:\n+ If you don't clear:\n- Attack damage of Dawn of Dreams boss (Haniere of Enchantment) increase by 10% (up to 50%).\n- Decrease player's hit rate in Border of Phantasm.\n\n+ If you clear:\n- All gimmicks caused by this dungeon will reset and re-spawned after 2 minutes.\n\n* Day of Return:\n+ If you don't clear periodically:\n- Spawn random explosion in Dawn of Dreams\n- Spawn Camouflage in Border of Phantasm\n\n+ If you clear:\n- All gimmicks caused by this dungeon will reset and re-spawned after 2 minutes\n\n* So think of the three dungeons as Anton's hatcheries, clearing them will stop annoying gimmicks and mob spawns in Black Volcano.\n* If you retreat from Dawn of Dreams, all 4 dungeons will re-spawn.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udeaaFloor 3\/4:\u00a0Gateway of Trials I\ud83d\udeaa* 4 dungeons (2 mirrors) will spawn.\n* Fragments of Memories and Memories of Fragments share the same patterns.\n* Upon clearing Fragment of Memory and Memory of Fragment, the teams will advance to the next gateway.\n* If you fail to clear Mirror of Trials within the time limit, the floor will reset. If clear on time, both dungeons will re-spawn after 90 seconds.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udeaaFloor 4\/4: Gateway to Suffering II\ud83d\udeaa+ 6 dungeons will spawn. 2 gateways, 2 mirrors, 2 castles connected to each gateway.\n+ Both light and dark Immaterial Gateways share similar mechanics.\n+ Both Castles share similar mechanics.\n+ One party has to be actively fighting the boss in Immaterial Gateway\u00a0before the connected Castle can be unlocked.\n+ Upon clearing both Immaterial Gateways, the teams will complete phase 1 and advance to phase 2.\n+ Each Castle clear will increase damage in Immaterial Gateways\u00a0by 40% (up to 200%)\n+ Same as floor 3, if you don't clear Mirror of Trials\u00a0within time limit, the floor will reset.\n\n\n\u2b9cPhase 2\u2b9e\n\n\ud83e\udde0Hall of Immateriality - The 3rd Plane\ud83e\udde0* 4 Hall of Subconsciousness will spawn. The boss is\u00a0Sirocco's Nightmare and is the same for all dungeons.\n* This level is simple, clearing all 4 will advance the teams to the next stage.\n  \n\ud83e\udde0\n\nHall of Immateriality - The 2nd Plane\ud83e\udde0  \n* 4 dungeons will spawn: 2 Altered Halls of Subconsciousness\u00a0(Boss: Old Hag In a Dream) and 2 Halls of Consciousness (Boss: Sirocco's Illusion).\n* Upon clearing both Halls of Consciousness, the teams will advance to the next level.\n* If\u00a0Altered Halls of Subconsciousness\u00a0is cleared, the boss in the connected Halls of Consciousness\u00a0will enter groggy phase.\n  \n\n\n\ud83e\udde0Hall of Immateriality - The 1st Plane\ud83e\udde0* 6 dungeons will spawn:\n+ Inner layer: 3 True Consciousness\n+ Outer layer: 3 True Subconscious\n\n* In this phase, you fight Sirocco in 3 different forms through 3 Consciousness, and the damage of three parties are cumulative. Bringing the health to zero will clear the raid.\n* As you're fighting the 3 forms, you will see Sirocco's health showing multiple colors. They are indication of damage for each colored party. As an example below, yellow party is the one doing the most damage.\n\n  \nThe Inner Layer* Three forms of Sirocco: Snake, Queen, and Leste\n+ After each groggy phase, the location of each form is randomized between 3\u00a0Consciousness.\n+ However, the clockwise order of 3 forms is always the same: Snake > Leste > Queen\n+ So even though it's randomized, if you know the location of one, you know the location of all three. Even if the\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0rotate, the order still remain same. Credit to\u00a0kdnf forum.\n\n\nThe Outer Layer* The purpose of 3 True Subconscious\u00a0outer layer dungeons are to set up groggy phase.\n* True Subconscious\u00a0is further spit into three type: Denial, Oppression, and Oblivion.\n+ Denial (Boss:\u00a0Sirocco's Nightmare)\n- If not cleared within the time limit, phase 2 will reset back to 3rd layer.\n- Once clear, the dungeon will re-spawn after 2 mins 30 secs.\n\n+ Oppression (Boss:\u00a0Kain Assassin in the Fog)\n- If cleared, the three\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0will rotate clockwise and is used to set up Resonance.\n\n+ Oblivion (Boss:\u00a0Roxy)\n- If clear at the state of Resonance, it will activate 25-sec groggy phase for Sirocco\n- Think of this dungeon as Observatory dungeon in Prey-Isys raid.\n\n\n\nHow to Activate 25-sec Groggy Phase* This phase can only be activated when the alignment of one\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0and\u00a0Subconscious: Oblivion are at Resonance phase. Once it's in place, clear\u00a0Subconscious: Oblivion will active groggy.\n* There are 2 ways to know the Resonance phase is in place:\n+ Pop-up video plays in the corner.\n\n+ The color changes in the map between\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0and\u00a0Subconscious.\n\n* So keep clearing\u00a0Subconscious: Oppression\u00a0to rotate\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0until the correct one line up. Once activated, all 3\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0merged and groggy phase start.\n* In simple terms, keep clearing\u00a0Kain dungeon until things line up, then send Roxy.\n  \nWhat Happen After the Groggy Phase* Very similar to Prey-Isys Raid, after the 25-sec, all parties in TC will be kicked out and have to wait 150 seconds to re-enter.\n* Basically you repeat the Resonance process until Sirocco is defeated.\n\n\n\nDungeon MechanicsPhase 1Phase 2  \n\n\nRaid Cutline & Recommended Gears* Since DFOG doesn't have API website, there's no way anyone can tell how much damage you can do in a 25-sec rotation just by looking at your gear.\n* Thus what you wear will determine if you're a strong applicant in the eye of a raid leader.\n\nFor DPS classes  \n* Weapon\n+ Level 100 epic weapon with +12 reinforcement\/+8 refinement.\n+ Sirocco Primal Dream weapon is fine too, make sure it's +5 modification.\n\n* Gears\n+ At least 5\/3\/3 sets or mixed 3\/3\/3\/2 level 100 epic sets.\n+ 3\/2\/2\/2 sets is really pushing it, you will have hard time getting in.\n+ Note that this is before any epic reworks so some sets will make you a stronger applicant than others.\n\n* Swap Set\n+ Preferably +10 skill, people don't seem to care much if it's Wrapped set or not.\n+ +9 skill is pushing the line here.\n\n* Enchants\n+ 2nd tier enchants should be plenty.\n+ Decent critical chances, 100% is preferred in dungeon but it's really depends on the class as well.\n+ Weapon: +12-15 elemental damage.\n+ Top\/Bottom: Physical\/Magic\/Independent ATK 45 ~ 50 with or without Strength\/Intelligence +20\n+ Accessory: +25 ~ 30 elemental damage. Some people pass for +18-23 if you have other part to compensate such as amplification.\n+ Magic stone: +18 elemental damage\n+ Sub Equipment: +42 PMI\n+ Earring: +100 ~ 125 All stat\n+ Pet\/Title\/Aura: At least some sort of modification (e.g. Attack damage, Elemental damage)\n+ Talisman: Both unique talisman. No one is gonna check if what you have is BIS for that class. As for runes, doesn't really matter that much.\n+ Avatar\/Emblem: Rare set with at least rare emblem that add Strength\/Intelligence.\n+ Insignia: Appropriate one your damage type with rare gems adding at least elemental damage.\n\nFor Synergy Classes* For the most part, these classes has a but of lower cutline but very similar to DPS in term of gears and enchants.\n* Your weapon doesn't really need to be +12, +11 should be okay.\n\nFor Sader\/Buffer Classes* Similar to DPS classes, 5\/3\/3 or 3\/2\/2\/2 set up with appropriate enchants.\n* Seraph\/Enchantress use Int enchants and Male Crusader uses Vit\/Spit enchants.\n* Level 100 epic cross.\n* Pet\/Title: At least 1 of each type that add level to 1A and buff skill.\n\n\n\nRaid Strategy* Note:\n+ Green and Yellow need to come back and clear mirrors as needed so phase 1 doesn't reset.\n+ Green and Yellow continue to clear Castle to give Red and Orange damage buffs.\n\n  \n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 57.14285714285714%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \n\n\nReferencesNamu.wikiPowerPoint -\u00a0Yong\\* (feat.

However, through the Exstream reddit summary, Neople denied this claim.\n* In this post, the author went back to run Stormy Route 401 times (1 extra time by accident) and compare the result to this previous blogpost (collected pre-Sirocco) to see if there are any differences.\n\nProcedure* The author kept the procedure same as the previous post (20 runs on each characters, sells all dropped, no repair cost, etc.).\n* On post-Sirocco data, character 18, the author accidentally ran 21 runs instead of 20 runs.\n* The\u00a0\u00a0column refers to the amount of golds dropped in dungeon plus gold flips at the end plus selling all drops (e.g. common, uncommon, rare, etc.)\n\nThe Data* For this analysis, the author will only show data for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\n\n  \nResult & Discussion* Disclaimer: The author is not a statistician, and the test was performed under the author's best knowledge from an undergraduate stat class. Feel free to suggest a better test.\n* From this website that list all the different tests, and since we're testing the difference between the drops from the same dungeon from 2 separate timeframes to test the nerf hypothesis, the author performed Two-Tailed Unequal Variance Independent T-tests.\n* You can read about how to replicate this test in Excel here.\n* With the P-value of 0.05, the author concludes that there are no differences in\u00a0\u00a0(p>0.05) and\u00a0\u00a0(p>0.05). However, there is a difference in\u00a0\u00a0(p<0.05).\n* The amount different in cumulative golds is about 8.6% (~3,900\u00a0\u00a0per run) comparing the two averages.\n* Worth noting that the definition of \"nerf\" differs between players. The original reddit post was referring to the gold flips at the end of dungeon. Some players claimed that the golds dropped from mobs were actually boosted to compensate for the decrease in gold flip. So since this data was collected under the intention of cumulative gold amounts, it may not reflects the \"nerf\" gold flips nor may it reflects the increase in golds dropped from mobs.\nTL;DR* Do I get less golds from farming Stormy Route?\n+ Statistically speaking: YES\n+ Is it realistically significant?

The whole process took about 35 mins with this gears. If you have the gear rewards from events, it may take up to an hour of playtime.\n\nStep-By-Step Process\n\n* The 1st Pit, you can clear the whole thing if you want, but at least clear the first few rooms for easy equip drops.\n* This doesn't require any Fatigue Points and give some easy gold selling to NPC.\n* Selling all gives ~67k.\n\n* Basement of Pain & Black Shrine Expert (2+2), these are must clear dungeons as part of DFO daily homework.\n* If lucky, you can some\u00a0, anyway, selling all drops now bring gold to ~145k.\n\n* Stormy Route, great place for gold farm with extra\u00a0\u00a0on the side.\n* Selling all drops EXCEPT for rare items now bring gold to ~870k.\n* Note to leave 8 Fatigue Point at the end.\n* Disaster Sector, great for farming\u00a0, only require 8 Fatigue Point to enter.\n* One clear of Level 3 Disaster Sector gives 27\u00a0.\n* Here you're out of Fatigue Points, now buy one Fatigue Potion on the Auction hall to recover 30 Fatigue Points.\n* Gold at this point down to ~796k.\n\n* Back to Stormy Route then Disaster Sector, 30 Fatigue Points will gives 2 extra Stormy clears and 1 extra Disaster Sector level 3 clear.\n* Total gain of 42\u00a0\u00a0and 54\u00a0.\n* Sold\u00a0\u00a0on Auction Hall at about 8.3k each and sold\u00a0\u00a0to NPC Pumpkin Ball.\n* Gold now up ~1.5 million.\n\n* Extra cash from Rare Items, the author put all rare items collected from Stormy Route on the auction hall, and the next day, 3 out of 5 items were sold, gaining an extra ~119k\n\n  \nResult and Discussion* Of course the drop rate of\u00a0\u00a0along with rare items may varies. Also you can't guarantee to sell all these rare items on the Auction Hall. But at the end of one character farming on a weekend, you can expect to get about 1.5 million gold\u00a0per day.\n* On a weekday, however, since you only have 156 Fatigue Points, you're about 2 Stormies short as compared to playing on weekend. You can expect to get about 1.4 million gold depends on how many\u00a0\u00a0drops on these 2 runs.\nRecommendation\n\n* The entire process took about 35 mins with this full epic gears. If this is one of your character, this process is great for gold farming for those that wants to get some dailies done and don't really have a lot of time playing. 1.5 million a day is about 10 million per week for just casual 35 mins of playing everyday.\n* For those players that don't have this type of gears,\u00a0Don't Ask. Double It!\u00a0gives you great gears to start out. You may be able to clear 2+2 expert but to be honest, 2+2 normal probably won't make much of a different in your gold gain. As for Stormy Route, +12 Epic weapon will give you decent clear time, you may struggle here and there, but with patients and determination, you can still follow this process. It may take you about an hour though. If Stormy Route is too much, Ghent Palace is a great alternative.\n* For those players that only have legendary and no epic weapon, you can still follow this whole process, but instead of Stormy Route, you can do Ghent Palace. Unfortunately, you would get less gold.\n\n\n\n","98":"\n\n* December 1, 2020 Updates and Events\n* Overview\n+ This update doesn't add any new contents.

PoW Talisman Selection) will be changed to have the same stats as the normal version, and modifications will give similar gains to amplification. This is to alleviate the stress of never finding the epic pieces you want to reach endgame.\n* About the new dungeon reward system:\n* We have prepared an item reward that ensures the highest value of the modifier you want, for the option to alleviate RNG.\n* We've considered player opinions and have added the option of changing weapon modifiers to increasing awakening skill levels for all classes to possibly use weapons with these stats.\n* The aim of the epic\/mythic rebalance is to close up the damage gap between sets. We aim to maintain the \"theme\" of each set.\n* In the future when we are developing new gears, we will put this into consideration, to have different \"themed\" gears that dont have major differences in damage.\n* We are working hard to develop the future neo awakenings. In the balance patch starting June, we will, use new skills, changes to skill numbers and changes to how the skills work themselves, to balance and close gaps between the classes.\n* Balance patches will be carried out over periods of time to receive reaction as we go.\n* As we've said, there will be no new characters or subclasses to be released before all the neo awakenings are released.

This articles outline how to enchants and recommendation on which one to use.\n\nTable of Contents* Basic Concepts\n* How to Apply Enchant\n* How to Upgrade Cards\n* How to Obtain Cards\n* Type of Class and Damage\n* Which Enchant to Use\n* Guides From the Community\n* Example\n\n\n\nBasic Concepts* Enchants are extra stats for your equipment. You can see them as green lines on the item.\n\n* Enchantment comes in two forms: Monster cards and beads.\n* Monster Cards:\n+ Monster cards can be looked up through \"DFOpedia\". In this window, you can sort the cards by slots and type of enchantments.\n+ They require enchanter shop to apply the stat, more on that later.\n* Beads: on the other hand does not require an enchanter shop to apply.\n+ Card can be turned into bead through enchanter profession.\n+ They are basically a more expensive version of monster card.\n+ For the most part as new player or returning players, most people don't really pay for beads. They are much more expensive and not worth it.\n+ It's in your best interest to use cards, with some exceptions of course.\n\n\n\nHow to Apply Enchant* For cards, you need to find an enchanter shop. They can be found looking like this.\n* After opening the shop, select the equip (1) and the card (2).\n* Click \"Enchant\" (3), it will ask for some materials depends on the equipment, then click \"Confirm\" (4). That's it.\n\n  \n\n\nHow to Upgrade Cards* Upgrading your card will increase its stat and will require other cards with the same rarity as material.\n* For example: in order to upgrade a legendary card, you need to use other legendary cards to upgrade it.\n* You can check how many time a card can be upgraded by looking at the top right corner.\n\n* You can upgrade your card through NPC Abello.\n* Talk to the NPC to open the \"Upgrade Card\" window.\n+ (1) is where you put the card you want to upgrade.\n+ (2) (3) (4) are the material cards needed to upgrade your target card. The more cards you put in these slots, the higher chance your upgrade be successful.\n+ (5) is the stats your card will gain with every upgrade.\n* Yes, upgrade card is also RNG, the more cards you used as material, the higher the chances. As an example below, one card is medium chance (1), two cards is high chance (2), and three cards will guarantee the card upgrade (3).\n  \n\n\nHow to Obtain Cards* The majority of the time, you get end game cards through raids or killing the corresponding monster in dungeon. For example, \"Awakened Wujo Card\" can be dropped by killing \"Awakened Wujo\" in \"Basement of Pain\" dungeon.\n* Beside that, you can get cards through \"Card Binding\" and \"Card Compounding\". Both are very similar. You can check if a card can be obtain through either of these 2 ways by looking at the writing at the bottom.\n+ \"Card Binding Device\" means card binding (duh).\n+ \"Card Crafting\" means card compounding.\n\nCard Binding  \n* Binding cards require binding devices. You can get those through \"Tower of Dazzlement\" dungeon in \"Valley of the Fallen Souls\" and NPC Simona.\n* Then open the device and start throwing your cards in there. The more cards you use, the higher chance you get the next grade card (up to unique grade).\n\n  \nCard Compounding* Very similar to using the binding devices, but here you use NPC Abello.\n* The more cards you use, the higher chances of getting the next grade card (up to unique grade)\n  \n\n\nType of Class and Damage* Your class and damage determine which enchants you should get. There are 5 common types:\n+ Physical Percent Class\n+ Physical Fixed Class\n+ Magical Percent Class\n+ Magical Fixed Class\n+ Buffers\/Saders (e.g. Male Crusader, Seraph, Enchantress)\n\n* For non-sader class, you can tell which group you are by looking at your skills. For example:\n+ (1) indicates the skill is physical damage\n+ (2) indicates the skill is magical damage.\n+ (3) You can see the percent sign indicates percent damage.\n+ (4) You just see the number, no percent sign, indicates fixed damage.\n\n* For your convenience, click this\u00a0Class Stats\u00a0excel sheet to see which one you are.\n\n  \n\n\nWhich Enchant to Use* For non-buffers:\n+ Priority 1: All benefit from critical chances. Priority these enchants before everything else.\n+ Priority 2: All benefit from elemental damages. They trump Physical\/Magical\/Independent Attack.\n+ Lastly, for Percent classes, you get most benefit from \"Physical\/Magic Attack\" and \"Strength\/Intelligent\" enchants, with attack as priority. For Fixed classes, you get most benefit from \"Independent Attack\" and \"Strength\/Intelligent\" enchants, with attack as priority.\n\n* For buffers:\n+ Seraph\/Enchantress: Benefits from Intelligent enchants. Get as much as you can.\n+ Male Crusader: Benefit from Vitality\/Spirit. Either one is fine, he has passive that equalize both stats.\n\n* For your convenience, click each gear slot below to be directed to the list of respected recommended cards\/beads (Non-sader\u00a0only).

The 3 possible options are: Dark Knight, Corrupted Village, and APC Rescue\n\n  \n* The illustration below will give you an idea of how the dungeon progress. The route you take will determine the bosses you face and the reward you get at the end.\n* Here's how the dungeon progresses.\n+ You face Jade (1), then pick your route to the next Crossroad (2).\n+ After fighting the bosses in that route, you face\u00a0Venta (3), then you pick your route to the next Crossroad (4).\n+ Again after fighting there, you fight\u00a0Onyx (5). But before her, you get to rescue an APC that give you a random buff and you also get to meet merchant\u00a0Posha, where you can reset your skill and buy various useful pots.\n+ You then choose your next route (6), fight all the bosses there then meet your final opponent\u00a0Astaros (7).\n* So regardless of which route you take, you get to fight at least 3 mini-bosses (one guarding each Crossroad) and you get to rescue at least 1 APC for a random buff.\n* NOTE: You can retreat without losing dungeon progress. From my understanding, after treating, you start back where you last kill a mini-boss. Keep in mind the more you retreat, the longer you need to wait to go back in. You can use this to your advantages such as resetting skill cooldown before a particular hard boss.\n\n\n\n* Once the APC is rescued, you can use the buff by using the \"Special Dungeon Key\" (defaulted as \"Tab\"). Name of APCs and their buffs below.\n\n* While you're in this route, there's a chance a Dark Knight OR a Follower can intrude. Defeat Dark Knight will increase final reward. Defeat Follower will give permanent damage buff. More details below.\n* Now let's see what you will face if you pick\u00a0Dark Knight and\u00a0Corrupted Village routes.\n\n\n\n* In the image below, each Dark Night (D, Right) is accompanied by a Follower (F, Left), and the pairs are always the same (3 total pairs). You will always fight Follower first, and each successful Dark Knight defeat will grand you more reward at the end.\u00a0 The pairs are:\n+ Drooping Darkness Jet and Timor the Pure Blood.\n+ Despero the Pure Blood and\u00a0Tiamat of Despair.\n+ Blood Drinking Banya and Verias the Doom.\n\n* Note: The location of each pair is randomized.\n\n\n\n  \n* If you pick this route, you will only fight Follower.\n* However, there's a chance his Dark Knight can intrude. If this happen, the\u00a0Dark Knight\u00a0will have less HP, and defeating this\u00a0Dark Knight\u00a0will grant you more rewards as if you were taking the Dark Knight route (yay).\n* The good thing is each Follow defeat will give you damage boost,\u00a03%, 8%, and 25%, respectively.\n\n\n\nPossible Routes* There are endless routes you can take to the final boss depends on your party composition and gears, and you need to weight your risk vs. benefit as well to see how many Dark Knight you want to face.\n* If you look at the rewards, it's divided into stages. So I will go over the route needed to achieve each stage.\nStage 1* Here you don't take any Dark Knight route at all. So your rewards will be minimal. Take this route if your party is extremely barebone.\n* In this route you only face 2 Followers and get to rescue 2 APCs.\n* If your party still really need the damage, you can also pick Corrupted Village route in the beginning (2) to get the 25% boost.\n  \nStage 2* Here you take down 1 Dark Knight.\n* I know the location of Dark Knight pairs are randomized but I'm not sure they would stay the same if you retreat and take another route.\n* So even if they are randomized but stay the same once you know which one they are, potentially you choose which one to take out (4 or 6). For example. if you get into (4) and that boss is too hard, you can take Village at (4) and do Knight at (6) instead, and vice versa.\n* I don't recommend taking Knight at (2) though because you may need that extra APC buff, and since you're only doing 1 Knight, might as well do either (4) or (6).\n  \nStage 3* Here you\u00a0take down 2\u00a0Dark Knight.\n* There's not really any other way. You can try to take Village at (2) if your party need that extra damage buff.\n  \nStage 4* Here you\u00a0take down 3\u00a0Dark Knight\u00a0and all 3 followers.\n* This is definitely the hardest route where you face ALL the bosses and mini-bosses this dungeon has to offer. So proceed with caution.\n\n  \n\n\nBoss Mechanics  \n\n\nTips and Tricks* Rescue APC Paladin Jenna when you can.\n+ After defeating Jade, you will have 3 options to pick which route to go next. Paladin Jenna will always spawn in the APC Rescue route.\n+ You can use her 15-sec groggy ability up to 2 times with 60-sec cooldown in between. So unless you're doing the stage 4, always rescue this APC.\n* Retreat to town with caution.\n+ If you're out of coin, you can always retreat to town and retry. Retreat will reset all your skills so you can use this as your advantage. However, retreat doesn't reset your 5 coin limit.\n+ However, be careful, the more you reset, the longer you have to wait to go back in (5 seconds, 80 seconds, 100 seconds, 130 seconds, 180 seconds, and so on). So I don't really recommend you retreat more than 2 times.\n\n* Know when to dump all your skills.\n+ First, the merchant\u00a0Posha can reset all your skills for just 1 time (left circle). So you can dump all your skill on the boss before him.\n+ Second, this go in hand with retreating, dump all your skill before the final boss (right circle). After that, you can retreat to reset skills then go back to fight the final boss. Since the first retreat only have 5-sec downtime, most parties use this strategy.\n* Know when to Sader 1A\/3A.\n+ NOTE: This content is focused on sustain damage, so sader should bind 1A to 3A. There you can cast 1A while 3A is on cooldown, and vice versa.\n+ For Stage 1-3, the recommend spots are below. Really self explanatory, here you combine both merchant Posha\u00a0and town retreat to reset your 1A\/3A.\n\n+ For Stage 4, since this is the hardest difficulty, you may have to retreat twice (once after 1st dark knight, then once right before final boss).\n  \n  \n\n\nRewardsFinal boss has chance to drop\u00a0Random Epic\/Mythic\/Product of Corruption\u00a0  \n\n\nPossible Monster Cards  \n\n\nReferencesKDnF Official Patch Note  \nReddit -\u00a0Merry's Guide  \nblog.naver.com  \nNamu.wiki  \nChangelog* July 13, 2021 - Clarified that retreat doesn't reset the 5 coin limit\n* July 12, 2021 - Added \"Tips and Tricks\" and reorganized 1A\/3A\n* July 8, 2021 - Added when to 1A\/3A\n\n\n","119":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2047\/Abellos-Gift?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","120":"\n\n* DFO is a great multiplayer beat 'em up action role-playing game. This game definitely reminds you of the 90s fighting game.\n* You're in luck because this game does have internal support for controllers. Unfortunately this internal program is not that great. You can move around, but you can't map the skills.\n* This article outlines step-by-step process of using an external program called Xpadder so you can play with any controller (XBox One as example).\n* Disclaimer: I know plenty of players in DFOG server that use external program to map out controller that have been playing for years and don't get banned. However, there are some people also claimed they get banned for it. Do your own research and use this guide at your own risk.\n\nTable of Contents* Purchase Xpadder\n* Before Getting Started\n* How to Set-up\n* Assign Your Keys\n* Tips & Tricks\n* Example\n\n\n\nPurchase Xpadder* You can download through this link\u00a0xpadder.com. The link looks sketchy but this is where I got it from. It costs $9.99 as one time payment.\n* Once entered in you will get email of how to buy with PayPal, then you get access to many other info such as forum, controller images, preset profile, etc.\n  \n\n\nBefore Getting Started* Make sure you connect your controller AFTER logging into DFO. The reason for this is that you don't want DFO client to recognize the controller and using its internal integration. We're trying to use a 3rd party program here.\n* Also make sure you run the program \"As Administrator\", and set up \"Compatibility Mode\" using instruction below.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nHow to Set-up* Once installed, open the program a make a new profile.\n* Then use the following steps to register the controller's keys.\n* A disadvantage of Xpadder is that it doesn't register special key such as \"Home\" key with Xbox One.\n* Once added your controller image (Xbox One as example) and register your keys, move them around to match your image.\n\n  \n\n\nAssign Your Keys* To assign a key, click on the key you want (1), then select what you want that key to do (2)\n* That's pretty much. Map all your keys and have fun playing DFO.\n\n\nTips & Tricks* Your default left and right thumbsticks only register 4 keys each, but you can change it so that it can do 8 keys each.\n* Note that you can adjust the sensitivity of the thumbsticks so it can give you less room of error and not accidentally casting the wrong skill.\n\n* We also know that DFO has lot of keys so it can be hard to register everything on one profile.\n* Luckily, Xpadder gives you option to switch between profiles so you can assign a set of keys on one profile and another set of keys on another profile.\n* Example swapping profile 7 and 8\n+ Click on a key (1), then \"Advanced\" (2)\n+ Pick \"Set Selector\" (3), then \"Set 8 Two-way\" (4) (two-way means each key stroke will send you between profiles)\n\n  \n\n\nExample* On the daily basis, I play DFO with 2 profiles. You can see some gameplay examples from my YouTube channel.\n* Profile 1 is where I register all basic keys such as movement arrows, skill quick slots \"QWERTV\" and \"ASDFGH\".\n* I also have quick slots \"123\" as potions and \"9\" as \"\/\/setitem\" for quick dungeon drops pick up.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Profile 1 |\n\n* Profile 2 is any other special keys that doesn't fit in profile 1.\n* Here I have \"F10, F11, F12\" for quick \"Dungeon Restart, Select Other Dungeon, Back to Town\" options, along with quick slot \"456\" as things like \"Faithful Owl\" and \"Ria's Communicator\".\n* I also have the \"right thumbstrick\" as mouse control and \"left\/right trigger\" as left\/right mouse click so I can sit on the couch and not have to reach for the mouse for some simple mouse clicking and changing characters.\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Profile 2 |\n\n\n\n","121":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2046\/Ancient-Dungeon-Adventure-Time?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","122":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2045\/Cleansing-of-the-Cursed-Cross?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2035\/New-Year-Tarot-Spread?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n  \n  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2070\/DFO-Content-Creator-Season-2?page=3  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/community\/contentcreators\n\n\n\n","125":"\n\n* Coefficient tablets are charts made by KDnF community.\n* In a nutshell, it gives every class the same gears, then rank the damage of every skill and talisman corresponding to each class. Therefore this is a useful tool to help you decide which skill to pick and which talisman to prioritize.\n* Please note that these tables change based on class balances and as more 3A are released. Be sure to check on the original source in the reference at the bottom for the most up-to-date info.\n* You can also quickly look up these tables in this\u00a0Coefficient Archive\u00a0page.\n* This article will attempt to show you how to read these tables.\n\nHow to Read* (01) Original name of skills\n* (02) Level of each skill\n* (03) Raw damage of each skill\n* (04) Raw damage with TP points\n* (05) Damage with self buff\n+ This number determines raking of each skill\n\n* (06) Percentage of damage and cooldown\n* (7,8) Passive skills name and their percent damage increase (?)\n* (09) Talisman skill\n* (10) Full damage of talisman\n* (11) Percentage of Talisman damage and cooldown\n  \nHow to Use  \n* Keep in mind that I'm not a min-maxing player, therefore these tables definitely have more usage than I can understand.\n* For skill build, I would pay close attention to column (4)(5)(6).\n+ (4) This is your TP damage, it's a good indicator of which skill you should invest TP on.\n+ (5)(6) are your damage with buff along with its damage\/cooldown ratio. Of course basic math here, bigger ratio means higher numerator (aka damage) and lower denominator (cooldown).\n+ As you can see, when deciding skills, you really need to combine all 3 columns AND your knowledge of how each skill works.\n\n* Example of how I would use this table:\n+ May rank very high on the chart. However, the damage\/cooldown ratio is relatively low, plus the skill has long animation. Thus not many players, including myself, max this skill.\n+ May rank very low on the chart. However, the damage\/cooldown ratio is relatively higher than other skills. Thus many players max these as sustain damage skills.\n+ Itself already a decent damage skill with great damage\/cooldown ratio. With its talisman, even though the damage ranking is not the highest, its damage\/cooldown ratio is very high. Therefore with both combination, this skill and talisman combination is a must.\nHow It's Calculated* To be honest, I'm not really sure how they come up with these number.\n* From the reference below, I know that these are the gear used, and they tested in Training Room using Meteor as the 25-second target. But beside that, I couldn't find any information about equation, target setting, etc.\n* It's a bit frustrated because I know lots of people use these tables, but I just can't figure out how they come up with these number.\n+ Weapon: +5 Modification Primal Dream\n+ Armor: +10 Amplification Mother Nature's Breath Set\n+ Accessories: +10 Amplification Elementalist's Accessory Set \u00a0(However, the cooldown reduction effect is not applied.)\n+ Special Equipment: +10 Amplification Normalizing Synchro Set\n+ Title: Advent of the Sado (+6 Elemental damage)\n+ Avatar: Rare Avatar\n+ Emblem: Unique Emblems\n+ Platinum Emblem: Emblem optimized for each class\n+ Creature: Book of Awakening SD Creature (2 cards +1 additional reflection)\n+ Insignia: +7 reinforced legendary insignia for each class & + 7 speed gem\n\nReferencesGamechosun.co.kr  \n\n\n","126":"\n\n* Ever wonder why everyone tells you to do your daily 2+2 dungeons?\n* Are you curious how much progression you can make with your characters?\n* How about drop rate and how many epics can you expect to drop from these dungeon?\n* This article will show you the result of 250 daily 2+2 runs.\n\nProcedure & Data* In case you didn't know, 2+2 means 2 Black Shrine and 2 Basement of Pain dungeon runs. Both have special rewards through card flip at at the end for the first 2 runs. So 250 total 2+2 runs is 1,000 dungeon clears.\n* The procedure was very simple, I ran 2+2 on multiple alts and record their\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drops. I didn't record any gold drops or gold from selling equipment. I also bought all from Gabriel and didn't pick any purple special reward cards.\n* In the data below, for the sake of data presentation, each group is a combined result of 25 data points, and each data point is the result of 2 Black Shrine and 2 Basement of Pain runs. For complete information of all data points, you can visit this\u00a0PDF file.\n* The \"Total Raw Gold\" is the price of all tradable stuffs (e.g.\u00a0). Prices used:\u00a048,500\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a07,397\u00a0.\n\n  \nDiscussion* How much progression can you get from doing 2+2?\n+ With level 100 cap, progression is quite simple actually. Since you can upgrade level 95 Fiend War and Prey slots in to level 100 epics, you really only need 4 good epic pieces to drop, 5 if you include weapon.\n+ Take my Female Spitfire for example, with her 4 drops, I can continue farming 2+2 for\u00a0, then upgrade 3 pieces Mother Nature, 3 pieces Normal Syncho, and then ditto the last piece through Oculus dungeon. As for weapon, you can do pit 456 for RNG weapon pot, or if you really desperate, transfer the weapon if it drop from other alts.\n+ Neople has been giving out\u00a0\u00a0and discount recipes through events, with just a couple months of farming, you can upgrade your equipment easily.\n+ Now can this strategy get you into Sirocco Red party? NO. But with optimization, you definitely have a chance for Green party.\n\n* What's the expected drop rate?\n+ As you can see from the data, after 1,000 runs, I got 89 drops. So it's about 9% drop rate.\n+ Note that this is a combination of both gold flip and drop from killing the boss though. I can tell you that the drop from killing boss is even lower, I didn't keep track, but I can definitely count it on two hands. So the drop rate probably around 8.5-9%.\n+ So if you're lucky, maybe you can get that good 4 pieces and 1 usable weapon. Most of my weapon drops from\u00a0Top 12 Progression\u00a0page is from these 2 dungeons.\n\n* Should you continue to farm 2+2 with characters that already 12\/12?\n+ Yes, definitely yes,\u00a0\u00a0can be converted into\u00a0\u00a0if you need to transfer that last epic piece.\n+ Each epic transfer requires 125\u00a0, which is 12,500\u00a0\u00a0(aka 12,500\u00a0). If you're new here,\u00a0\u00a0is not your bottleneck. Farming 126\u00a0\u00a0for a weapon or 168\u00a0\u00a0for a equipment is not that hard. It's getting 125\u00a0\u00a0is the hard part.\n+ Therefore, keep farming these\u00a0\u00a0so you can eventually funnel to gear up other characters. As a bonus, you get about 2 million gold for every 25 daily 2+2 runs, and that is not including the white drops you can sell to NPC. Gearing up alts, and cash on the side, 2 birds with 1 stone.\n\n\n","127":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2069\/Lovey-Dovey-Tobys-Gift?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","128":"\n\n* Test server note was released on January 27, 2021.\n* Live server note was released on February 2, 2021.\n* It adds knight's 3rd awakening along with 10 floors expansion to Cursed Ruby dungeon and new area for Arad Adventure system.\n\nTable of Contents* Knight 3rd Awakening\n+ Elven Knight\n+ Chaos\n+ Paladin\n+ Dragon Knight\n+ Idle Animation\n+ Official Trailers & Artworks\n\n* Cursed Ruby Expansion\n+ Hidden Dungeon\n+ New Reward Chest\n\n* Arad Adventure Subjugation\n+ New Subjugation Reward\n\n* References\n\n\nKnight 3rd Awakening\n\nElven Knight* Straight Damage Increases\n+ +23%,\u00a0+22.6%,\u00a0+20.8%,\u00a0+23%,\u00a0+23.3,\u00a0+20.1%,\u00a0+23.7%,\u00a0+23.1%\n\n* Other Skill Changes\n+ Overwhelm: Attack +22%.

After 7 months of data, I finally hit my 1,000th ebin.\n* Are you wondering what they're consist of? This post will show you.\n* All raw data is located in this\u00a0PDF file.\n\nTop Duplicates* Of course my #1 drop is a weapon, and one of them is an Agent's weapon.\n* Top duplicate are:\n\n  \nTop Locations* To be honest, I didn't really do Guide of Wisdom that much. Rarely did I remember doing full 156fp bar.\n* As you can see, Basement of Pain and Black Shrine counts are very similar (33.8% vs. 32.6%).\n* A very small portion drop is from Land of Memories and Bottomless Tunnel. I did get quite a bit of drops from the event dungeon though.\n* As for Oculus, I only do on the character that I need. When I got the Ditto, I was slacking on doing the dungeon on the weekly basis.\n\n  \nTop Character Drops* It's ironic that my main Male Ranger is actually not the top character getting the drops.\n* Apparently Male Spitfire leads the chart with 114 drops, followed by Female Nen with 113 drops.\n* Most of these drops are from doing daily 2+2, you can follow their gearing path in details through this\u00a0Top 12 Progression\u00a0page.\n  \nTop Slots* No shocker here, Weapon is the #1 with 364 drops, and yes, Agent weapon  is one of the top drops.\n* If you think about the distribution of level 100 epic, this chart reflects it pretty closely.\n* There are 19 tops, bottoms and shoes; 15 belts and shoulders; 8 bracelets, necklaces, rings, sub, stone and earrings. lastly there are 74 weapons.\n* However you can't find ele, syncro or mother so we takes those out and that leaves us with 18 tops, bottoms, and shoes, 14 belts and shoulders, 7 bracelets, necklaces, rings, sub, stone and earrings. for a total of 198 epics.\n* This would put tops, bottoms and shoes at 9% drop rate; belts and shoulders at 7% drop rate; the entire right side at 3.53% drop rate; lastly weapons would be 37.37%\n* Looking at pie chart, it's VERY close, well within error.\n\n  \nMythic Drops* Lastly, How many Mythic?\n* You can't see it on the chart due to small numbers. I got 20 Product of Wisdoms and 3 Mythics. I only got 2% PoW, but it makes sense because I didn't really do Guide of Wisdom that much. Since PoW doesn't drop in 2+2. This number would definitely higher the more you run Guide of Wisdom.\n* Only 3 Mythic out of 1,000 drops. Looks like my RNG is not that good.\n  \nChangelog* 2\/24\/21\n+ ADDED: Clarification in \"Top Slots\" and \"Mythic Drops\"\n+ Thanks to the great feedbacks from a viewer who wished to remain anonymous.\n\n\n","131":"\n\n* With Exile Mountains update, expansion to the talisman system is added, and I'm sure lot of players will be asking which one they should use.\n* Wondering which talisman is better? This article outlines my recommendation that you should consider when picking your next talisman.\nWhich Talisman Should I Use?* Back when we only have 5 talismans, we have a KDnF popularity list to guide us on which talisman should you use.\n* Now with this expansion, we don't have any guideline from Korea on which we should use. So here is my advice and recommendation you should consider when picking your next talisman.\n* In a nutshell, Talisman system intention is to provide players variety of ways to customize their skills. At the bottom line, look at it in 2 angles, damage advantage and structure advantage. Damage and cooldown usually go hand-in-hand, so really 3 things.\n* And of course, considering these things will require you to READ and use your brain,\u00a0I know it's hard, DFOG players can't read \\*insert meme here\\*\n\nDamage Advantage* What you need is to learn how to read damage chart. It basically takes all talisman's damage and their cooldown and rank them. Here're\u00a0Coefficient Archive\u00a0(aka damage charts) and\u00a0Simple Guide to Damage Coefficient Table\u00a0(aka how to read these tables).\n* Note that just because a talisman is top damage, doesn't mean you should pick it. You need to take cooldown into consideration. \"Damage\/cooldown ratio\" is where I would pay close attention to, especially newer contents tend to head toward sustain damage (e.g. Exiles and Black Purgatory).\n\nStructure Advantage  \n* Ask yourself, does this talisman make sense to use? does its skill augmentation worth it?\n* Personally, what I looks for is if a talisman allows me to cast the skill easier and if I can cancel it out to another skill. Those quality-of-life rank higher for me.\n\nExample* Male ranger is my main, so I'll show you my thought process of choosing this 3rd talisman slot.\n* Below is the damage table for his talisman, we have skill name (1st column), its damage (2nd column), and damage\/cooldown ratio (3rd column).\n* The 2 new talisman are Fast Draw\u00a0\u00a0and Wipe Out\u00a0, now think about your \"Damage Advantage\", we clearly see the winner (Fast Draw) due to higher overall damage. Not only that, the damage\/cooldown ratio is better as well.\n* How about \"Structure Advantage\"? Below is what the skills look like. Fast Draw\u00a0\u00a0allows you shoot faster (aka reduce cast time), which can be a huge advantage since you can fit more skills in between Death Hawk\u00a0.\n\n* For Wipe Out\u00a0,\u00a0instead of casting the skill at a distance, you now cast it right where you are.\n* For me, it's not really an advantage because male ranger doesn't really cast that many skills while he's right on the target except for Wild Shot\u00a0\u00a0and Deadly Approach\u00a0\u00a0really. Beside that, Male ranger usually do damage standing in front of the target, not right on it. So for me, it doesn't really make sense to use Wipe Out talisman.\n\n* In conclusion, looking at damage\/cooldown ratios and structural advantages of both talismans, I'll be using Fast Draw\u00a0.\n\nReferencesExcel -\u00a0KDnF 75\/80 Talismans  \n\n\n","132":"\n\n* This review is only for the talisman version from Pandemonium War dungeon.\n* This article outlines pros and cons of Male Ranger 5 talismans and recommendation of which one should you use.\n\nTable of Contents* 1.

Advantages\n+ Structure change: The main point of this talisman is to always fire the bullets at max speed without scarifying any damage. Originally you need to continuously hit the \"attack\" button to increase firing speed.\n+ Damage: Great damage increase (+29.7% from my testing). Based on the coefficient table, this skill is not the top in term of raw damage increase. However, the damage\/cooldown ratio is amazing. With 25-sec rotation in sirocco, you can definitely fit 2\u00a0.\n\n\n\n* 1.3. Disadvantages\n+ There's none really. This talisman fires so fast that you don't need to worry about missing any shot even if the boss move around a lot.\n\n* 1.4.

Advantages\n+ Structure change: Originally, you need to tap the arrow keys 5 times to fire all the shot. The main point of this talisman is to combine all to just 1 shot. It also scan all the area around you and hit every target in those area. Personally it's a great quality-of-life improvement to the skill, but at the same time, I'm not butt hurt if I need to press the same key 5 times.\n+ Cast time: Both with or without talisman, you're immobilized for a very similar amount of time. Although if you can hit the key fast enough, this talisman could be a no-no for you.\n\n* 2.3. Disadvantages\n+ Damage: The increase is not that great (+21.8% from my testing). Again with the ecoefficiency table, the damage increase and damage\/cooldown ratio are both worst than\u00a0.\n\n  \n\n\n* 2.4. Overall Review\n+ This talisman offers great structural improvement to the skill. You now don't even need to press the skill multiple times. Which I can see as selling point for some players.\n+ But at the same time, the damage increase is not great. There are other better talismans out there, thus I can't recommend this talisman for regular usage.\n+ Thus, OKAY to use if you don't have other better talisman\n\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n  \n\n\n3.

Description\n+ Throwing count -1\n- Starts throwing the Hawk after its first return.\n- 1st and 2nd attack multi-hit interval -30%\n- 1st attack Atk. +8%\n\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- Hawk size +40%\n- Hawk interval +100%\n- Catching the Hawk doesn't push you backward.\n\n+ Firing skills can be used to auto re-throw the Hawk.\n- Consumes 1\u00a0Stylish\u00a0\u00a0stack.\n- Headshot,\u00a0\u00a0Wild Shot,\u00a0\u00a0Multi Headshot,\u00a0\u00a0Suppressive Barrage,\u00a0\u00a0Fast Draw, and\u00a0\u00a0Wipeout\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage With Talisman |\n\n\n\n* 3.2. Advantages\n+ Structure change: This talisman in a nutshell decrease the cast time of the skill in a specific way. You lose 1 hawk throw, but in return, the throw spin longer, bigger, and more multi-hit. This is very important because the bread-and-butter of male ranger is not just Death Hawk, it's the skills you cast in between the throw that gives him damage and make him unique.\n+ Without talisman, it's close to impossible to cast more than 1 big skill in between throw because the spin interval is way too short. In the example below, I couldn't fit\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0in between the spin.\n\n\u00a0+ With talisman, due to the longer spin time, even through you're losing 1 throw, you can cast more than 1 big skills in between throw, thus making him more viable. In the example below, I can cast\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0with the 1st throw, and\u00a0\u00a0with the 2nd throw. This extra time definitely gives you more opportunity to play around with for all your rotation practice.\n\n+ Damage: In term of coefficient table, this talisman is top of the chart, AND it's damage\/cooldown ratio is amazing as well.\n\n\n\n* 3.3. Disadvantages\n+ None really, this talisman is so good, pretty much everyone uses it.\n\n* 3.4. Overall Review\n+ This talisman offers great structural changes to the skill and is a complete game changer for male ranger. Even though it takes away 1 spin, but in return, you get higher damage and the spin last longer so you can fit more skills in between.\n+ On the plus side, its damage and cooldown ratio is on the top of the damage chart among all male ranger talisman.\n+ This talisman is a MUST-have.\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n4. Level 60 Skill - Deadly Approach\u00a0\u00a0(Prey Hunt\u00a0)\n\n* 4.1. Description\n+ Auto-casts\u00a0\u00a0Western Fire upon landing.\n- Auto Western Fire Atk.: 17% of overall Deadly Approach Atk.\n- Does not consume\u00a0\u00a0stacks when cancel-used.\n- Can't be used at 0\u00a0\u00a0stacks.\n\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- The auto Western Fire replenishes 1\u00a0\u00a0stack on hit.\n- Additional Auto Western Fire Atk. +5%\n- Cooldown -10%\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n\n\n* 4.2. Advantages\n+ Structure change: The only thing this talisman has to offer is the extra\u00a0. Note that this does NOT share cooldown with the actual\u00a0\u00a0skill. So technically you can cast\u00a0\u00a0(with\u00a0\u00a0as bonus), then\u00a0, then\u00a0\u00a0again)\n\n\n\n* 4.3. Disadvantages\n+ Damage: It offers a small cooldown to the skill but absolutely does nothing to the skill\u00a0\u00a0itself. All you're getting is an extra\u00a0. Its damage\/cooldown ratio is not great either.\n\n\n\n* 4.4. Overall Review\n+ This talisman really doesn't do anything to the skill itself. It only add an extra\u00a0. In a way, it automatically re-direct yourself so you face the target as you land (if you can call that an advantage).\n+ Beside that, there's nothing great about this talisman.\n+ Highly NOT recommended.\n\n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n5. Level 70 Skill - Suppressive Barrage\u00a0\u00a0(Magazine Handling\u00a0)\n\n* 5.1. Description\n+ Firing duration +0.3 sec.\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- Finishing Atk. +52%\n- Attack Speed +20%\n- Attack range +30%\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n\n\n* 5.2. Advantages\n+ Damage: Coefficiently speaking, it's the 2nd best in damage. Here you also have higher range and higher attack speed.\n\n\n\n* 5.3. Disadvantages\n+ Cooldown: Damage\/cooldown ratio is really at the bottom of the list. The skill itself already has a 50 seconds cooldown, lots of male ranger players don't max this skill (I do personally). Even though the damage increase is high, its cooldown is the main downfall.\n+ Skill duration: The description said only increase of 0.3 second. But when I tested the skill, it seems to increase much more significantly (look at the gif comparison above).\n\n* 5.4. Overall Review\n+ From a technical point of view, the skill cooldown already way too long to put SP on. And adding the terrible damage\/cooldown ratio, this talisman is really the bottom of the list.\n+ Highly\u00a0NOT\u00a0recommended.\n\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n6. Overall Recommendations* Since you only have 2 slots, I highly recommend Death Hawk and Wild Shot.\n  \nReferencesSkill Icon -\u00a0DFO Wiki  \nCoefficient Archive  \n\n\n","133":"\n  \n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2076\/Dungeon-Miner-Online?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","134":"\n  \n\u00a0https:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2077\/Honey-Time?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","135":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2078\/Master-of-The-Exile-Mountains?page=2  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/notices\/2171\/Master-of-The-Exile-Mountains-Winner-Announcement?page=1&srch=title.master\n\n\n\n","136":"\n\n* Undaunted Determination is a great way to funnel your characters.\n* Ever wonder why many veterans cap them weekly? This article outlines this process in details along with my example.\n\nTable of Contents* What is Undaunted Determination?\n* What is it Used For?\n* How to Cap Weekly Limit\n+ Top Tier: Many Sirocco Ready\n+ Mid Tier: Prey Over-Geared But Not Enough For Sirocco\n+ Low Tier: Only Legendary Gears\n\n* How I Do It\n\n\n\nWhat is Undaunted Determination?\n\n* It is a universal reward for clearing raids (e.g. Fiend War, Prey, Sirocco). You can get up 4,000\u00a0\u00a0per week.\n* You will get different amount of\u00a0\u00a0based on the type of mode you do.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is it Used For?* is primarily used to buy epic soul boxes from the raid shop and RNG reward from \"Raid Special List\".\n* You can access the raid shop though the main DFO menu.\n  \n* Through NPC Magar, you then can trade each\u00a0\u00a0for 20\u00a0, which you can use to run Guide of Wisdom to roll your RNG for level 100 epics.\n* As you can see, this is a great way to funnel your resources into a character you want to gear up.\n\n  \n\n\nHow to Cap Weekly Limit* Unfortunately, each character can only get 650\u00a0, so you will need at least 7 characters to cap this weekly limit.\n* Another thing, due to weekly raid entry limit (2 per raid per character), you will\u00a0need to do more than 1 type of raid. For example, doing only Sirocco on 7 characters will only give you 2,800\u00a0\u00a0so that's not enough.\n* So how much raid do you need to do? I'll break it down based on the type of player using the least amount of effort.\n\n\n\nTop Tier: Many Sirocco Ready* If you can do Sirocco, you can do Prey raid.\n* Using 7 characters, you only need to 14 Preys and 6 Siroccos.\n* With 7 Sirocco ready characters, you can enter easy 4-man Prey party, if you can find a group to people to do your Prey train, you can knock it out easily and quickly.\n\n\n\nMid Tier: Prey Over-Geared But Not Enough For Sirocco  \n* These are the type of characters that are strong enough to enter 8-man prey party. Usually a mix of level 100 legendary and epic sets.\n* Of course, if you can do Prey, you can do Fiend War, using 7 characters, you need 14 Preys and 10 Fiend Wars. Technically 8 Fiend Wars are enough to cap, but since you cap at 650\u00a0\u00a0per character, you will need the 2 extra Fiend Wars.\n* Since Fiend War is a lot easier, you could potentially do 14 Fiend Wars and 11 Preys instead. Again due to cap 650 per character, you will need that extra Prey.\n\n\n\nLow Tier: Only Legendary Gears  \n  \n* Technically speaking, having full level 100 legendary gear should be enough to do Prey raid. However, with pub raid nowadays, you will have hard time getting into 8-man party, let alone 4-man party, and 12-man party is very rare.\n* So potentially, unless you want to wait a long time for a 12-man prey party, you can only do Fiend War here. And you will need more than 7 characters, 14 to be exact (aka 27 Fiend Wars).\n* In the other hand, asking a new player to make and play 14 characters is extremely UNREALISTIC. So my advice is if this is you, don't worry about this process yet.\n\n\n\nHow I Do It* You can look at my\u00a0Top 12 Progression\u00a0and judge for yourself.\n* For me, Sirocco pub raids take way too long to fill up. So I only do it on 1 character. Therefore most of my raiding to cap this is from Preys and Fiend Wars.\n* On the weeks that I'm busy on the weekend, I do about 13-14 Fiend Wars on Wednesday, about 8-9 Preys on Thursday, 1 Sirocco each on Friday and Saturday.\n* On the weeks that I'm free on the weekend, I do about 10-11 Preys on Thursday, 1 Sirocco each on Friday and Saturday, then 7-8 Preys on Saturday.\n\n\n","137":"\n\n\n\n\n\nChantri Town\nchantri.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

Your Fiend War and Prey gears can now be upgraded to level 100.\n* This article outlines in detail this upgrading process and is meant for new or returning players.\n\nTable of Contents* Required Materials\n* What Gears Can Be Upgraded?\n+ Left Side (Fiend War raid)\n+ Right Side (Prey raid)\n\n\nRequired Materials for Upgrading* In the nutshell, NPC Dorothy is the one doing the upgrade for you. She can be found in Chest Town in Dark Side region (image below)\n\n* In the example below, all you need to do is drag the item into the window. Each upgrade requires 1,850 Black Crystals\u00a0\u00a0and 50 Aiolites\u00a0. You get to keep your enchantment \/ reinforcement \/ amplification this way.\n* Depends on the reinforcement and amplification of the original piece, you may need to provide some Engraving Stones\n\n* Black Crystals are reward materials from Black Shrine and Basement of Pain dungeon, located in Roschest. You can get the rewards twice per dungeon per character per day.\n* Aiolites can drops from these 2 dungeons and all other level 100 dungeons.\n\n* Engraving Stone can be trade in through NPC like Loton.\n* can be traded for by 1 Wisdom Crystal , which can be traded for by 100 Wisdom Crystal Fragment\u00a0.\n* are drops from Guide of Wisdom dungeon and can be also be traded\u00a0from .\n\n  \n\n\nWhat Gears Can Be Upgraded?* The only gears allowed to upgrade through this path are Super Tayberr armors (Left Side) and Prey Accessory\/Special Equip pieces (Right Side).\n* Unfortunately, you can't upgrade your level 95 weapon.\n  \n\n\nLeft Side* Regardless of the Super Tayberr type, they will all be upgraded to \"Mother Nature's Breath Set\"\n* This set is not top tier but it's pretty good for a straight forward upgrade.\n* Super Tayberr can be upgraded from Regular Tayberr set, which can be bought through NPC Joshua in Pandemonium Junction using Sky Fragment\u00a0. You can get\u00a0\u00a0from Tayberr dungeon, Pandemonium Meeting, 1st Pit & 2nd Pit.\n* In order to upgrade your Tayberr armor, talk to NPC Masked Knight in Elvenguard.\n* Upgrading each piece will require 75\u00a0\u00a0and some other materials. On average, you can expect to upgrade each piece every about 2 weeks worth of raids.\n\n* That's a lot of walking, so there's a way you can skip all of that and just buy the recipe from the Raid shop.\n* Using this you get to skip the buying Regular Tayberr part, the downside is it requires 96\u00a0\u00a0instead of 75, you still need 20\u00a0\u00a0though.\u00a0So it's up to you which way you want to get there.\n\n* If you want to skip that 20\u00a0\u00a0too, you can use the \"Antimatter Dynamo Box\" from the Mileage shop.\n\n  \n\n\nRight Side* Regardless of which set you pick, they will all upgrade to the same level 100 sets.\n* Accessory will upgrade to \"Elementalist's Accessory Set\". This set is not as great for DPS\/syn classes, however with the epic rework, it got a small boost.\n* Special Equipment will upgrade to \"Normalizing Synchro Set\". Similar to left side, this set is great for a straight forward upgrade.\n* Very similar to upgrading Left Side, you get Prey Equipment from upgrading Regular Tayberr pieces (bought from the same NPC Joshua).\n* You can upgrade by using \"Chest of Power\" in \"Ashen Grave\". It will require 140\u00a0\u00a0and similar materials. Unlike Fiend War, each piece will take about 1 month worth of Prey raids.\n\n* Again, same as upgrading Left Side, you can buy the recipe from raid shop or mileage shop to reduce material costs. You gonna need 190\u00a0\u00a0instead of 140 though.\n\n\n\n","139":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2103\/Cloaks-and-Daggers?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","140":"\n  \n  \n\u00a0https:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2100\/4-Weeks-of-Bliss?page=2\n\n\n\n","141":"\n  \n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2101\/Altimate-Power-Leveling-20?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","142":"\n\n* Ever wonder how much effort is needed to make that weekly transfer? Wouldn't it be nice to be 12\/12 in 3 months?\n* Assuming you only have 156fp per alt, this article will show you how many characters you need to play.\n* Too much reading? \ud83d\udc49 TL;DR\u00a0\ud83d\udc48\n\nRequired Materials* The mats for weapon is a bit cheaper, but here I'll do the math for other slots.\n* In a nutshell, 2 notable materials are 168 Epic Souls\u00a0\u00a0and 125 Wisdom Crystal\u00a0.\n\nEpic Souls* How in the world can you get 168\u00a0\u00a0in a week?\n* Your 1st main source is from raid, capping weekly\u00a0Undaunted Determination\u00a0\u00a0will get you 40\u00a0. You can read more about it in this\u00a0How to Cap Weekly Undaunted Determination\u00a0post.\n* 2nd main source is Dawning Crevice (DC), I only started collecting data for only 200 runs, so far, you can expect to get at least 8\u00a0\u00a0per 50 dungeon clears (aka 25 characters), assuming you have the worst luck and not having any epic drops. I have details how to convert these materials into epic souls in my\u00a0Gold Farming\u00a0guide. Think of it this way, for every character you do DC on, that's enough mats for about 0.32\u00a0.\n\n* So to get the remaining 128\u00a0\u00a0in 7 days, you will need to do daily DC on at least 57 alts to get enough mats.\n* The 3rd way for this to farm gold and buy Product of Wisdoms (PoW) then dissemble them. If farming DC on 57 alts is not enough work for you, the more stormy you farm, the more PoW you can buy and grind for more souls.\n+ 156fp will only get you 19 stormy runs, and let's say you do your daily 2+2 and 2 DC runs, that'll leave you with 13 stormy runs per character.\n+ Looking at my\u00a0Stormy Route: Sirocco \"Nerf\" Debunked\u00a0data, 13 runs will get you roughly 775k. With PoW price about 1 million gold each, you can expect to get about 3\/4\u00a0\u00a0per character.\n+ If you add the average soul gain from DC to this method (0.32+ 0.75), you can expect to get about 1\u00a0\u00a0per character (aka, do 2+2, then 2 DCs, then spent rest of fp on stormy, then sell all drop and\u00a0).\n+ So if you're following this path instead, you can get 128\u00a0\u00a0by doing about 18.3 alts per day. (Pick your poison, 18 alts on 2+2 DC stormy daily or 57 alts on just DC daily).\n\nWisdom Crystal* 125 Wisdom Crystal\u00a0\u00a0is 12,500\u00a0Wisdom Crystal Fragment\u00a0, which is about 1,785 needed per day.\n* There're 4 main dungeon sources of\u00a0:\u00a0Guide of Wisdom, Basement of Pain, Black Shrine, and Oculus. Beside Guide of Wisdom, the other 3 dungeons give\u00a0, which can be converted into\u00a0\u00a0at 1:1 ratio from NPC Loton.\n* Looking at my\u00a0Black Shrine and Basement of Pain: Result of 1,000 Dungeon Runs\u00a0data, you get about 61\u00a0\u00a0per day, doing that 7 days a week and add reward from your 2 weekly Oculus runs (46\u00a0\u00a0each run), you get about 518\u00a0\u00a0per week per character.\n* So 125\u00a0\u00a0will require you to do daily 2+2 and weekly Oculus on about 24 characters. Assuming you don't do any Guide of Wisdom at all. That calculation doesn't include the 60fp needed for weekly Oculus runs per character, so you're looking at even more stormy farming.\n\n\nTL;DR* To transfer 1 non-weapon level 100 epic per week, you will roughly need:\n+ For\u00a0: Cap 4,000\u00a0\u00a0through raids. Then full 156fp burn on 18 alts daily or DC on 57 alts daily.\n+ For\u00a0: Do daily 2+2 and weekly Oculus on 24 alts.\n\n* As you can see, the\u00a0\u00a0is really the bottleneck in this process. Not many people do Oculus on 24 alts, let along waiting on pub parties to fill up.\n\n\n","143":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/pg\/Fanart-Contest-6th-Anniversary  \n\n\n\n\n","144":"\n\n* Test server note was released on March 24th, 2021.\n* Live server note was released on March 31th, 2021.\n* This patch adds Black Purgatory Guide & Squad mode, along with changes with Sirocco rewards QoL and Cursed Ruby.\n\nBlack Purgatory New Modes* Will cost 30fp to enter and will require\u00a05938 exorcism.\n* They both share same entries as normal mode and similar entry (once per day, thrice weekly, twice weekly reward).

When you enter the dungeon, you're basically fighting waves of enemies. The more waves you can survive, the more reward coins you get at the end. You will fight a boss every 10th wave.\n* In the top right corner, you will see a count down, you don't have to kill everything on the map before the clock hit zero. However, if it hits zero, the next wave will come.\n\n* After you finish the \"Remaining Kills\" (For example, 12 kills from the flag above), the game will give you 5 ability options to choose from. Again and again, you get to choose an ability after each wave.\n\n* From the event page, there are 3 type of ability options to choose from:\n+ Type 1: These increase your character stat (e.g. All attack, crit chance, attack speed, etc.)\n+ Type 2: These increase your character skills (e.g. increase attack, range, decrease cooldown of a particular skill)\n+ Type 3: These are random epic piece (e.g Natural Guardian, Centurion Hero, etc)\n\n* As you can see, there're some RNG involved in this event, sometime you get good options to pick from and sometime you get jack nothing. But regardless, I will give you some recommendation on which one should you pick to help you get as close as wave 50 as possible.\n\nGeneral Strategy* What options should you pick LAST?\n+ Critical Chance: When I first started doing this dungeon, I thought to myself, \"Well, gear doesn't affect my stat, but if I can get my crit rate up, I can kill things faster\". But I was wrong, although crit rate is important, it still doesn't give you the best benefit.\n+ HP\/MP regeneration: This usually only a problem during your first 10-20 waves, I found myself run low at 30-40% MP. From my runs, if you have to, 1 HP\/MP regen should be enough to last the whole dungeon.\n+ Movement\/Casting\/Attack Speed: This option is not bad, however, if you get \"Full Plate Armor\" piece as an option, pick that instead and it should provide you with plenty of speed.\n+ Physical\/Magical Defense: Personally, I don't recommend you pick this one. Higher wave mob (30+ wave) are really strong, most of them 1 shot you anyway. There're just way better options to pick.\n\n* Which options should you pick FIRST and FOCUS on?\n+ After looking though various\u00a0Youtube videos, the main strategy is to pick and stack one skill as much as you can. So whenever you can, try to pick That Skill first.\n+ Secondly, Epic pieces will give you huge boost. Many of them give you Skill Level (Centurion Hero\u00a0), Decrease Skill Cooldown (Eternally Flowing Path\u00a0), Super Armor & Speed (Full Plate Armor\u00a0), Skill Attack (Elemental Dropper\u00a0), many many more.\n+ With mobs from wave 30+ getting more and more annoying, many of them stun and one-shot you. There are many instances where 20 of them stun me over and over, I was pretty much killed and couldn't do anything. As you can see, if you can get an epic that give you Super Armor, Speed or Invulnerability, try to grab those.\n+ Lastly, All Attack +10% option is great to get too.\n\nExample using Female Sader* Below are the options I picked during a run. I was able to get to wave 42 before getting one-shotted. Hopefully with enough practice and good RNG, I can get to wave 50.\n* As you can see, I stacked\u00a0Uriel's Ward\u00a0\u00a0as much as I can. The range of this is skill is huge, it also provide I-frame for you. The more you stack this skill, you can just spam it.\n* I also got plenty of epic pieces and Attack damage. I got some Physical\/Magical Defense, Critical Chances as well because those are the only decent option during those waves.\n\n\n","146":"\n\n* NOTE: This article is a direct archive of Yong\\*'s translation.

Certain debuff \u201cthat will force players to completely change the game style\u201d will be casted if the level drops to a certain level.\n+ Interactive Difficulty selection: Raid members will be able to change the difficulty of raid interactively during the raid (Instead of choosing \u201cHard Ozma raid\u201d at the start, the difficulty and the reward would fluctuate depending on path players take during the raid. I.E. skipping x maps will increase the raid difficulty to high, but doing y maps will decrease it back to normal, or even to an easy-mode raid.)\n+ Reward Auction: Raids cleared with Hard difficulty will have a chance to encounter \u201cJackpot Reward\u201d (on top of normal rewards that every member receives) that will be put up on auction within the raid. Players will bid gold to win the prize, and gold from the winning bid will be distributed among the raid.\n\n* Xlation Note: From the language he uses, it seems like this \u201cMega Flip\u201d will happen on top of normal gold cards.\n+ My attempt as an analogy to Sirocco raid (100% MY GUESS):\n+ Extra Account bound mats, Sirocco Epics, Monster Cards, Weapon Residue would be Normal Gold flip (players win individually)\n+ Mythic and Primal Dream Weapons (PoW) would be put up on Auction.\n\nFull Note* Greetings, This is Jeong Ho Kang, Lead Director of DnF\n* First, we thank every adventurer playing and observing Dungeon and Fighter as it progresses.\n* This Director\u2019s Note will focus on improvements on Sirocco Farming and new mechanics currently under development for the upcoming (within first half of this year) Ozma raid .\n\nSirocco Farming Improvements* Considerable amount of time has passed since Sirocco Raid has been released, and many adventurers made significant progress in farming their gears.\n* However, we acknowledge that many are struggling to graduate due to the RNG nature of the raid, as well as many newcomers who started farming later than others.\n\n* With anticipation of the upcoming Ozma raid, we wanted many more people to attend the new raid with satisfactory gears. Thus, we allowed the players to buy Residue with a set amount of Petals, as well as introduce a method to fuse \u201cdeadweight pieces\u201d into a random piece from the selected set.\n\n* We also decreased the cost of Sirocco Ditto, materials needed to convert the ditto, and removed the petal cost to defuse Sirocco Epic, as an attempt to decrease the overall cost of changing Sirocco gears to the desired set.\n* Above improvements will be implemented in Live server on April 1st, and we anticipate this to benefit not only those struggling, but also allow graduated characters to grow even stronger (optimize with stronger set).\n* With more people trying their best to prepare their characters for the Ozma raid, we (neople) will also try our best to develop a high quality raid.\n\nNew Raid: Ozma Raid* We are developing multiple new mechanics in an attempt to appeal \u201cOzma\u201d to as many adventurers as possible, from those who remember him in Otherverse dungeons to new adventurers who have never heard of an Apostle named Ozma.\n* Today, I am introducing a few of the many systems we are currently developing.\n* First, \u201cSanity Level\u201d mechanic.\n+ Adventurers fighting Ozma in \u201cDark Side\u201d will be under the influence of Ozma. Each player will have its own \u201cSanity Level\u201d gauge that will fluctuate depending on the battles fought against the mobs.\n+ Players who lost sanity (gauge hits 0) will receive significant debuff that will put them in disadvantageous position, thus we expect the players to pay close attention to their gauge.\n+ Additionally, we will implant various gimmicks to utilize the Sanity Level, one of which the raid (as a whole) can upgrade to soothe the subjugation process.\n+ We are avoiding this system from becoming dull by only encouraging players to maintain high sanity. For example, certain stats (damages) would be amplified at low sanity (as a reward for taking high risk). We are striving this new mechanic to be as dynamic as possible.\n\n* Next is the interactive difficulty selection, first introduced in \u201cDark Purgatory\u201d dungeon.\n+ Xlation note: Dark Purgatory has a mechanism where players choose the difficulty (up to 4 levels) depending on what path the party takes. Instead of choosing \u201cHard mode\u201d at the start like P. War, every party starts at level 1, and will be given the option of increasing the difficulty to receive better rewards. Oculus has a similar mechanism where players can choose to skip Luiese or Roseberry to change the difficulty of Shoyun but it doesnt change the rewards. In Black Purgatory, and the Ozma raid, the party will receive additional rewards for taking the harder route.\n+ We added an interactive method of difficulty to give players freedom to make decisions based on the current situation (being able to decide AFTER observing the power level and pattern proficiency of the party).\n+ However, we noticed that the current system implanted in Black Purgatory provides an insufficient amount of freedom to make optimal decisions. In Ozma raid, we will allow players to not only increase the difficulty of the raid, but also an option to revert the choice to provide even more degree of freedom.\n+ We are hoping players to take a shot at challenge mode without burden of risk.\n\n* Finally, We are planning to introduce first ever (in DnF history) system: Raid Auction System.\n+ Xlation note: This system has been in WoW for eons, but the raid leader was able to lead the auction (for whom to attend, and how the item and gold to be distributed, etc). I was told other kMMOs such as Lost Ark and Blade&Soul have similar systems\u2026 but there has always been some degree of controversy in each of the games. I am both excited and worried about this system, especially knowing how prevalent \u201csells\u201d are in the endgame contents of DNF.\n+ Will customers be able to attend the auction? Will they receive the cut of the winning bid? Would it be fair? Will \u201cfriendship\u201d between static raid members be at risk? Who knows. We don\u2019t even know if this system will be 100% automatic by the game, or raid leaders (or players) would have influence in the process.\n\n* Throughout many raids, we found the need of raid scale \u201cfeedback\\*\u201d on top of the individual feedback that previous raids provided..\n+ Xlation note:\u00a0\\*Kang uses word \u201cfeedback\u201d to mean \u201crush of Adrenaline\u201d or \u201csense of winning\u201d\n\n* Thus we are preparing to implant a Raid Auction system to Ozma raid.\n* Normal Rewards will be provided to every participant similar to Sirocco raid, while the raid cleared in certain difficulty will drop a shared loot that can be auctioned among the raid participants. Player with the highest bid will win the item.\n* Additionally, we are designing a system where the gold from the winning bid can be distributed among the raid members to allow other players to enjoy the sense of victory.\n* On top of systems introduced in this note, we will try our best to make Dungeon and Fighter as enjoyable as possible to our adventurers.\n* Thank you.\n\nReferencesKDnF Director's Note  \nYong\\*'s Translation\n\n","147":"\n\n* Othello is old board game invented back in 1971, which is a version of the original\u00a0Reversi game of the late 1800s.

Then at the end, whoever has more pieces will win.\n* This is a game strategy, and here I will show you some tips to help you win.\n\nTip #1: Prioritize the space you want to put your piece on* Generally, the edges of the board are your top priority, especially the corners.\n* If you can, these corners should be your #1 pick, the reason is that there is no way you can lose that piece.\n* Here's an example, I got my piece on the corner of A8, and it gave give me an advantage across the board, vertically horizontally and diagonally. So I put my piece on F3, and turn the entire row.\n\n* Below is another example of Red player utilizing the edge pieces to overtake the whole row.\n\n  \nTip #2: Avoid the RED Zones* Below are the red zones, where you should try your best to avoid playing your pieces on. The reason is that if you place your piece on these slots, you give your opponent the opportunity to take over the edges (remember tip #1?)\n* HOLD ON, 8 of those slots are also the edges, which you told me to take priority on. Why you're telling me now that they are red zones?\n\n  \n* The reason is that if you put your piece there, now you opponent can have the chance to take the corner piece, which is the last thing you want. I'll give you an example.\n* Starting from the left picture, the Red player thought that he could be smart and place the piece on H2, thus taking out 3 of my pieces (middle picture). However, by doing so, he gave me the opportunity to place my Blue piece on the corner of H1.\n\n  \n* So in the end, think of these 8 slots as more of Yellow zone instead of Red. They are good to take advantage of, but at the same time, proceed with caution.\n\n\n","148":"\n\n* This artbook package was announced during the 2020 Winter Festival as part of celebrating DnF 15th anniversary.\n* This article outlines its physical and digital contents.\n* SPECIAL THANKS to Yong\\* for providing numerous images and footages to the artbooks.\n\nTable of Contents* How Much & Where Can I Get One?\n* What's in the box?\n+ Book 1\n- Prologue & Chapter 1\n- Chapter 2 & 3: Character designs\n- Female Priest Illustrations\n- Male Gunner Illustrations\n- Female Slayer Illustrations\n- New 5th Female Slayer\n\n+ Book 2\n- Prey Raid Illustrations\n- Sirocco Raid Illustrations\n\n+ Pixel Art Book\n+ Posters\n+ Digital Contents\n\n* References\n\n\nHow Much & Where Can I Get One?* This package costs 78,000 Won, which is equivalent to about $69 USD, excluding shipping & handling.\n\n* You can get it through 4 websites:\n+ Yes24.com: Sold Out\n+ Book.interpark.com: Sold Out\n+ Kyobobook.co.kr: Sold Out\n+ Aladin.co.kr: Sold Out\n\n\n\nWhat's in the box?\n\n* Within this treasure you will find 2 big art books that contain illustration of characters, monsters, apostles, dungeons, and many more.

Each class gets one passive, one skill and one awakening, all brand new. This patch also provides various skill damage buffs.\n+ Class artworks and details are located in\u00a0Neople official website.\n\n* Events\n+ They Who Engulfed the Abyss\n+ Moment of Truth\n+ Spring is in the Abyss\n\n* Sales\n+ Return to Harlem Package\n\n* Comments\n+ Return to Harlem Package\n- I think this package is very budget to gear up your alt. The title is only 10% modifier, but that's still better than having no title at all.\n- The bonus boxes are nice, especially the Remy's Sparkling Touch, 500 count for about 2.3 mil gold on auction hall is not a bad price.\n\n+ They Who Engulfed the Abyss\n- Simple generic 3A event, nothing really special here\n\n+ Spring is in the Abyss\n- Nice exp capsule and level up ticket\n- BUT:\u00a0The background image can be used until 09:00, DEC 31, 2021 UTC. Why??? I was hoping it would be permanent.\n\nMoment of Truth* Think of this as an upgraded honey time. I love that they give us options. So which one should you choose? this event last for 28 days\n* With rewards from 15 mins, you can get:\n+ 2,800\u00a0, which is enough to buy 4 tayberr pieces. This really is the best option to pick because you can eventually use them to upgrade to Super-Tayberr then upgrade to level 100 epics. You can learn more in this\u00a0How to Upgrade Level 95 Epics to Level 100 Epics.\n+ 8,400\u00a0, which is enough for 14 Ghent pieces. Not really worth it since you can farm all 12 pieces in like 2 days, so there's no reason to wait 28 days for this.\n+ 2,800\u00a0, which is enough for about 5 non-weapon swap pieces. This is probably your second best option if one of your alt still need buff swap pieces.\n\n* With rewards from 30 mins, you can get:\n+ 2,800\u00a0, which is plenty to upgrade one 95 epic to 100 epic. This is your best option, looking at my 1,000 Black Shrine & Basement of Pain runs, this many mats is equivalent to about 46 days worth of doing 2+2 on one character. So if you're new and only have 1 character, this is 46 days of progress in 28 days.\n+ 1,400\u00a0, which is not even enough to buy 1 Dark Dimension Piece. Looking at my Dark Dimension small data, this is only 12 days worth of progress. So this option is not recommended.\n+ 2,240\u00a0, which is only enough to buy 1 legendary piece. Looking at my Land of Memory and Bottomless Tunnel data, this is about 3.7 days worth of progress. So, yeah, terrible option to pick.\n\n* With\u00a0 rewards from 60 mins, you can get: 83 days worth of Contract, 280\u00a0, or 84\u00a0. Really up to you. Contract is probably the best option, creature food and potions are cheap to get from package's bonuses.\n* With rewards from 120 mins, you can get 560\u00a0, 84\u00a0, or 28\u00a0. I think the Stone is probably your best option. If you were gonna buy the\u00a0\u00a0from the action hall and convert to 560\u00a0, that's about 26 million gold worth.\n\n\n\n","154":"\n\n* As a Beat-'em-up MMORPG game, DFO has a function that allowing you to manually assign commands to all your skills.\n* Here I'll go over some simple tips & tricks so you can get the most benefit out of this system.\n\nWhy Would You Use This?* You only have 12 quick slots. Well, every class in the game has at least 1 buff skills, among many many other skills.\u00a0So you will not always have enough space to put them.\n* Take Female Nen for example, she has at least 3 buffs that I cast at the beginning of every dungeon\u00a0. If I put those 3 on the hot bar, where would I put the other skills.\n* How about Female Spitfire, I need to cast 3 buffs\u00a0, so there's no way I would have enough space for other skills if I put them on the hot bar. If you play sader classes, you will even need more manual skills.\n\nHow to Assign Manual?* First, click on a skill, then click \"Change\".\n* A window will open where you can put in whatever manual you in it.\n\nGeneral Principles* A manual input usually contain a set of arrow key and one letter.\n* So which letter can you use? There're only 4 letters you can use. They're letter used for \"Skill\", \"Skill2\", \"Normal Attack\", and \"Jump\" skills. You can see which those letters are under \"Settings\" then \"Hotkey Settings\".\n\n* As you can see, my \"Skill\", \"Skill2\", \"Normal Attack\", and \"Jump\" skills are Z, Space, X, and C. So I can only use those for manual input.\n* What do input usually consist of?\u00a0In a nutshell, at least 1 arrow key & 1 letter. For example, most of my character's buff skills are \"\u2191+Space\"\n+ You can register up to to 4 arrow keys, so go ham and be creative. You can use whatever input as long as you follow those simple principles. For example, \"\u2190\u2193\u2192\u2192 +C\", \"\u2190\u2193\u2192+Z, \"\u2193\u2193\u2191\u2191+Space\", etc.\n\n* Can you just put a letter?\u00a0Yes, a manual input can just be a letter (for example, Z or Space). HOWEVER, you CANNOT use Normal Attack key and Jump key by themselves.\n\nWhat Key To Avoid* I would say don't use the \"Jump\" key as an input because it can get confusing because sometime in dungeon, you want to jump to avoid certain gimmicks.\n* I would avoid using \"\u2192\u2192 + Normal Attack\" as a manual, especially if you're a gunner. Because that's the combination for doing run and dash move.\n  \nWhich Skill?* Which skill should you use manual inputs? Generally speaking, buff skills are the ones you don't really want to put on hot bar. I put all my buff skill on all my character as \"\u2191+Space\".\n* High cooldown skills are good options, such a 1st 2nd or 3rd Awakening skills. I have the majority of my Awakening skills as \"\u2191\u2191+C\" and \"\u2193\u2193+C\".\n* For example: My female sader, I used \"\u2193\u2193+C\" for 3A, then when that's going, I used \"\u2191\u2191+C\" for 1A.\nProTip* Not many people know this, but this system can register an arrow as HOLD. On the command, you will see it register as \"\u2191&\" (right pic) instead of \"\u2191+\" (left pic).\n* To register this, simple press the arrow key, hold it for a few seconds, then register you letter key. Note that if you use this hold function, you can only use ONE arrow key.\n\n* Why does this hold function matter? Well, you can use this as a \"combo\" manual. In stead of using 2 different manuals for 2 skills, you can now just use 1 similar input.\n* For example: For my Female Nen, I used \"\u2191+Space\" for\u00a0, then \"\u2191&Space\" for\u00a0.\n+ Remember the Hold function? After casting\u00a0, because I already have my finger on the \u2191 arrow (it will register it as a hold), now all I need is to press \"Space\" again for\u00a0.\n+ So instead of using like \"\u2191+Space\" and \"\u2191\u2191+Space\" for 2 skills, I pressed \"\u2191+Space+Space\" and casted 2 skills spontaneously.\n* Here's another example using THREE skills:\n+ I used \"\u2191+Space\" for\u00a0, \"\u2193+Space\" for\u00a0, then \"\u2193&Space\" for\u00a0.\n+ Why the Down arrow? because after casting\u00a0, the Down function is \"Neutral Bullet\" which increases Skill attack.\n\n+ So \"\u2191+Space\" to cast\u00a0, then since my finger already on \u2193 arrow after picking the element, I pressed Space to cast\u00a0, THEN since my finger already HOLD \u2193 arrow, I pressed Space again to cast\u00a0.\n+ There you go, I pressed \"\u2191+Space+\u2193+Space+Space\" to cast 3 skills spontaneously like a pro.\n\n\n\n","155":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2208\/Many-Thanks-from-Mia?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","156":"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 1.

Adventurers must defeat Gizel's powerful weapons, including G\u00e1e Bulga, with the help of the 7 Meisters.\n+ Starting with this Meister's\u00a0Laboratory, I would like to tell you about the changes in the difficulty direction of advanced dungeons in the future.\n+ Existing advanced dungeons are designed to be able to proceed without unreasonable difficulty in clearing them once the entry is possible. The reason was to minimize the hurdles for entering and clearing content in the early stages of growth and farming.\n+ However, the advanced dungeons that will be updated from Meister's Lab in the future aim to become content that you want to challenge and clear. For this reason, advanced dungeons are expected to be applied as a \"minimum admission standard\" rather than a \"appropriate playable standard\" as a challenging content.\n* Story: A laboratory where 7 Meister finally conducted the secret project \"Code Name G\u00e1e Bulga\" to defeat Bakal.\n+ While developing G\u00e1e Bulga, numerous security systems and weapons were deployed to fend off possible intruders, and it consists of a maze-like complex passageway.\n+ Except for Eternal Flame, who guards the laboratory with the 7 Meister , no one will be able to pass through this territory safely.\u200b\n\n* Arts & Illustrations:\n+ Main Art:\u00a01024 \u2715 768 | 1280\u00a0\u2715\u00a01024 | 1680\u00a0\u2715\u00a01050 | 1920\u00a0\u2715\u00a01080\u00a0| 3200\u00a0\u2715\u00a01800\n+ Monster:\u00a0GB-1 Haps |\u00a0GB-2 Identate |\u00a0GB-3 Energi |\u00a0GB-4 Diregent |\u00a0GB-5 Feluhan Stark\n+ Area:\u00a0G\u00e1e Bulga Field |\u00a0Meister's Lab | Weapons Depot | Power Charging Room |\u00a0Energy Production Room |\u00a0Automatic Response Room |\u00a0G\u00e1e Bulga Boarding Point\n+ NPC:\u00a0Meister Jenne |\u00a0Meister Eldirh |\u00a0Meister Rati\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Teneb\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Volgan\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Curio\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Odruz\n\n* Fame Requirement: 26,933 (Normal) 31,795 (Expert) 34,198 (Master)\n* Entry Material:\u00a0\u00a0Meister's Laboratory Admission Ticket + 30 FP\n+ Each difficulty will have their own ticket. If you buy the Expert ticket, you can also enter normal mode. If you buy Master ticket, you can also enter expert and normal mode.\n\n* Dungeon Information:\n+ Time Limit: A 30-minute time limit applies at the start of the content. As long as you do not leave the party, you can continue to challenge for a limited time.\n+ Dungeon Abandon:\u00a0The party leader can retreat from the dungeon using the retreat button on the status board. When retreating, re-entry to the dungeon is not possible for a certain period of time. When retreating, the skill cooldown is maintained. After retreating, you can select 'Abandon mission' through NPC 'Meister Curio'. All dungeon progress will reset and entry materials will not be returned.\n+ Combat Restrictions: When using coins in the dungeon, the skill cooldown is maintained\n\n\n\nDungeon Progression* Operation Deterrence:\n+ Players can use the EF-MK1 vehicle to block the movement of G\u00e1e Bulga.\n+ One EF-MK1\u200b vehicle can be boarded by one driver\/one anti-aircraft gunner by entering the 'Z' key, respectively.\n- Up to 2 vehicles will be prepared.\n- If only the driver is in the EF-MK1\u200b vehicle, the AI \u200b\u200bwill fire instead.\n- The vehicle's defense changes according to the driver's reputation.\n- The vehicle's attack power is changed according to the anti-aircraft gunner's reputation.\n\n+ You can block the movement of the G\u00e1e Bulga by reducing the HP of one of the parts to 0.\n+ You can identify your vehicle with the icon ().\n+ When the vehicle's health is exhausted, all players in the vehicle will die. Players can be revived using coins (player in driver's seat will get priority).\n\n\n| Type | Key | Icon | Function |\n| Common | Tab |  | Swap The Positions Of The Driver's Seat And Gunner SeatBullets\/Missiles Are Recharged.\u200b |\n| Driver's Seat | Arrow Keys | - | Move The Vehicle Up, Down, Left, Or Right |\n| A |  | The Vehicle Dashes Forward Quickly |\n| C |  | The Vehicle Jumps Upwards |\n| Gunner\u2019s Seat | A |  | Fires Bullets |\n| S |  | Launch Missiles |\n\n* Infiltration Operation:\u200b\n+ The pattern of certain monsters will be weakened depending on the part the player destroys in the Deterrence Operation.\n+ You can finally clear the dungeon by defeating 'GB-1 Haps' located in the center of the Meister Lab.\nChanges From Test Server* A security system is added to the Meister's laboratory. When defeating a boss except for GB-1 Haps, a security system is activated.\n* This security system increases the attack power of all enemy monsters. During this time, some computers on the map become hackable. Successfully hack those computers will disable the security system and apply various effects to other bosses.\n\n* If the security system is hacked using a computer, the security system level will be lowered.\n+ When the security system is successfully hacked, some bosses will have a functional error effect.\n+ For functional errors, attack power increase and defense decrease are applied at each stage.\n+ If the security system hack fails, nothing happens.\n\n* The attack power of monsters appearing in Meister's Lab is readjusted.\n* GB-1 Haps' attack pattern has been added and changed.\n* GB-2 Identitate level 3 enhanced monsters have been changed to 2 monsters.\n* GB-3 Energi's attack pattern has been added and changed.\n\n\n\nScenario Dungeon Rewards\n\n|  | Normal | Expert | Master | King | Tradability |\n| 105 Rare Equipment | X |  |  |  | Tradable |\n| 105 Unique Equipment | X | X |  |  | Untradable |\n| 105 Epic Equipment(Fixed Option) | X | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Frost Crystal Fragments | X | X |  |  | Untradable |\n| Shining Frost Crystal Fragments | X | X |  |  | Account-Bound |\n| Ominous Crystal |  | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Resonant Ominous Crystal |  | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Ryan Core |  | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Golden Beryl |  | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n\n  \n\n\nAdvance Dungeon Rewards\n\n| \u00a0 | Normal | Expert | Master | Tradability |\n| 105 Epic Equipment(Fixed Option) | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| \u200b105 Epic Equipment(Custom Option) | \u00a0 | X | X | Untradable |\n| 105 Legendary Equipment | X\u00a0 | X | X | Tradable(Sealed) |\n| Fragment Of The Deep Abyss | X | X | X | Tradable(Cannot Be Exchanged When Worn, Cannot Be Resealed)\u00a0 |\n| Abyss Battery | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| High Efficiency Abyss Battery | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Condensed Ryan Core | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Shining Harmony Crystal | X\u00a0 | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Flawless Golden Beryl | X | X | X | Tradable |\n| Carbon-14 Crystals | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Meister's Lab (Normal) Admission Ticket | X | \u00a0 | \u00a0 | Tradable(1 Time) |\n| Meister's Lab (Expert) Admission Ticket | X\u00a0 |  | \u00a0 | Untradable |\n| Meister's Lab (Expert) Admission Ticket |  | X |  | Tradable(1 Time) |\n| Meister's Lab (Master) Admission Ticket | \u00a0 | X | X | Untradable |\n| Meister's Lab (Master) Admission Ticket | \u00a0 | \u00a0 | X | Tradable(1 Time) |\n| Monster Card | X | X | X | Tradable(1 Time) |\n\n  \n\n\nNew 105 Epics* New level 105 Epics that can be obtained from Meister's Lab Advanced Dungeon are added.\n+ 11 new fixed optional epic (1 type for each part excluding weapons)\n+ 11 new custom optional epic (1 type for each part excluding weapons)\n\n* The following 11 epics are originally translated by DFOG previous Content Creator \"Yong\\*\", and reworded by me (Raven).\n* Metal Gear Arm Shoulder\u00a0(\uba54\ud0c8\uae30\uc5b4 \uc554 \uc204\ub354)\n+ Option 1: Receive a buff \"+25% cooldown recovery\" upon entry (except awakenings)\n- For every 6 combo, skill recovery \u22125% (up to 5 stacks) (i.e. cooldown gets longer)\n- For every skill used, reduce the penalty stack by 1 (i.e. +5% cooldown recovery)\n\n+ Option 2: Apply buff \"+2,223 Damage Amplification\" upon entry\n- Combo duration \u22120.5%\n\n+ Option 3: +5% physical \/ magical critical rate\n+ Option 4: +5% MAX MP\n\n* Confused Core Suits: Top (\ucee8\ud4e8\uc988\ub4dc \ucf54\uc5b4 \uc288\ud2b8)\n+ Option 1: For every cube skill, summon D011-Risa (0.5 sec cooldown, up to 5 summons)\n- Apply every aliment that the strongest mob on the map has to Risa (synergize with the next option)\n- If you are within 500px of Risa, gain 2% aliment resistance of the aliment\u00a0that Risa has (up to 5 stacks)\n\n+ Option 2: For every aliment resistance gained from Risa, 5% additional aliment damage (up to 10%)\n- Note: So with combination of option 1 and 2, you get 10% more burning \/ shocking \/ cursed \/ freeze damage.\n\n+ Option 3: P+5% physical \/ magical critical rate\n+ Option 4: \u22127% MP consumption\n\n* Robotica Combat Pants\u00a0(\ub85c\ubcf4\ud2f0\uce74 \ucef4\ubc43 \ud32c\uce20)\n+ Option 1: For every 6 amplification \/ reinforcement of your equipped slot, +272 Damage Amplification\u00a0(up to 24 stacks)\n- This is 100% whale item.

you can check it in the expected reward and equipment guide in the dungeon selection window.\n\n\n| Difficulty | Before | After |\n| Hero Normal | 18 ~ 43 | 23 ~ 48 |\n| Hero Expert | 18 ~ 48 | 23 ~

Note: We have confirmed that those who develop characters with an adventurer fame of less than 24,000 as their mains are having difficulties in the process of growing the option level for 105 Epic.\n+ In particular, we identified the most problematic part was that it was difficult to figure out how to efficiently grow with several equipment already acquired.\n+ Accordingly, it has been decided to add one new Level 105 Epic equipment for each part (excluding weapons). These equipment are \"only for optional growth materials\", and drop more in general dungeons with slayer difficulty or lower.\n\n* 11 new level 105 epic equipment are added for the purpose of \"only for optional growth materials\". The equipment has the following features:\n+ There is 1 type each in 11 slots other than weapons.\n+ There are no other options other than the damage increase option.\n+ When used as a material in the option growth system, the option level and experience are added to this equipment as it is, regardless of the equipment's options.\n+ It can be obtained from the following dungeons and does not affect the drop rate of existing epic equipment.\n\n* 110 Level Normal Dungeon Normal ~ Slayer Difficulty (Excluding Heroes Mode)\n+ Vericollis: top, bottom\n+ White Land: Bracelets, Rings\n+ Canyon Hills: Necklace, Accessories\n+ Queen Fallt: head, shoulder, bottom\n+ Nasau Forest: Accessories, Earrings\n+ Eternal Flame Lab: Shoes, Waist\n+ King\u2019s Cradle: Bracelet, Magic Stone\n+ Heblon's Prophecy: Top, Waist\n+ 100~110 Lv Scenario Dungeon All Difficulty\n+ Meister's Lab Scenario Dungeon All Difficulty\n\n* It cannot be used in the option transfer system and the option level transfer system.\n* Material change, equipment grade change, and all enchantment systems cannot be used.\n* Cannot be obtained from random pots or selection boxes.\n* Compared to other 105 Level Epic equipment, the adventurer's reputation is set lower.\n\n* Dev's Note: Since the value of the types of rewards that can be obtained when playing on Normal Mode difficulty in Level 110 normal dungeons is low, we are trying to improve it.\n+ First, in Gabriel's secret shop and urgent mission rewards of Expert ~ Slayer difficulty, we have changed so that you can acquire Noblesse Code tickets and Destroyed Castle of the Dead with maximum expert difficulty.\n+ And it has been changed to acquire level 105 epic equipment up to option level 58 with a low probability in Normal ~ Slayer difficulty, and in emergency missions, it has been changed to acquire level 105 epic equipment of higher option level.\n+ Lastly, we have doubled the drop rate of level 105 Epic equipment, limited to Normal difficulty.\n\n* The sales list and probability of Gabriel's Secret Shop in Level 110 Normal Dungeon Expert ~ Slayer difficulty are readjusted. In the case of Expert difficulty, the probability of selling tickets is set lower than in Master ~ Slayer difficulty.\n\n\n\n| Sale Item | Difficulty\u00a0 | Tradability |\n| Expert | Master | King | Slayer |\n| Level 105 Epic (Fixed Option) | X | X | \u00a0X | X\u00a0 | Untradable |\n| Resonant Ominous Crystals | X\u00a0 | X\u00a0 | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Golden Beryl | \u00a0X | X\u00a0 | X\u00a0 | X\u00a0 | Account-Bound |\n| Condensed Ryan Core | X | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Essence Of The Rift |  | X | X | X | Tradable |\n| Noblesse Code (Normal) Admission Ticket | Addition | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Destroyed Castle Of The Dead (Normal) Admission Ticket | Addition | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Noblesse Code (Expert) Admission Ticket | Addition | Addition | Addition | Addition | Account-Bound |\n| Destroyed Castle Of The Dead (Expert) Admission Ticket | Addition | Addition | Addition | Addition | Account-Bound |\n\n* The list and probability of the urgent mission reward list are readjusted in Level 110 Normal Dungeon Expert ~ Slayer difficulty.

However, please note that the probability of being dropped to an option level higher than the 'Main Item Option Level' is very low, so it is not indicated in the Dungeon Expectation Reward UI.\n\n\n| Difficulty(Level 100~110 Scenario DungeonMaster's Lab Scenario Dungeon) | Difficulty(Level 110 Normal Dungeon) | Before Change | After Change | After Change(Emergency Mission) |\n| Normal \/ Expert \/ Master | Normal \/ Expert | 1~30 | 1~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 1~20) | 10~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 10~30) |\n| King | Master | 10~40 | 10~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 10~30) | 18~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 18~38) |\n| - | King | 18~48 | 18~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 18~38) | 23~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 23~43) |\n| - | Slayer | - | 23~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 23~43) | 23~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 23~48) |\n\n* The drop rate of Level 105 Epic equipment has been doubled in Level 110 Normal Dungeon Normal difficulty. The same applies to level 100~110 scenario dungeons and Meister's lab scenario dungeon expert difficulty.\n\n\nItem Recommendation Board* Dev's Note: \u200bAfter reaching level 110, the item recommendation board allows you to check recommended items based on class, and was added in anticipation that it will be helpful for farming. We are planning to provide various conveniences in the future.\n* The item recommendation bulletin board is divided into an item tab and a combination search tab, and items are recommended in different ways. This board will be available in various endgame dungeon areas.\n* Item tab:\n+ The Item tab shows recommended items for each part based on the class, and you can also check the recommended items of other characters by changing the class.\n\n* Item selection:\n+ You can select an item by clicking the left mouse button, and you can check the acquisition information of the selected item.\n+ Also, a menu for \"Combination Search\" is activated when right-clicking the mouse.\n+ If you select 'Combination Search', you can check various combinations based on the selected item.\n\n* Combination search:\n+ Combination search allows you to check various combinations based on the selected item.\n\n* Check the combination:\n+ Based on the selected item, the item is recommended after searching for an item with the same remaining parts.\n+ Recommended item efficiency is not an indicator of the best efficiency, so only use it for reference purposes.\n\n* Hashtags:\n+ You can check the characteristics of the combined item with a hashtag that is duplicated in the combined searched item.\n+ Non-duplicate hashtags are not displayed.\n\n\n\nImprovements and Changes* Improved display of equipped equipment\u00a0(Added with Live Server)\n+ Equipped equipment UI where you can check\u00a0 currently equipped equipment, all hashtags will be added\n+ In the hashtag information tab, you can check the representative hashtags of the equipment being equipped.\n+ Representative hashtags display the most hashtags among the hashtags included in the device in descending order.\n+ Up to 3 representative hashtags are displayed, and they are displayed as icons on devices that contain the hashtag.\n+ Some hashtags do not appear as representative hashtags.\n+ You can check all hashtags for currently equipped equipment.\n+ Only hashtags that are included in 2 or more parts are displayed for all hashtags displayed.\n+ If you click a hashtag that is displayed, it will be searched for that tag in the encyclopedia.\n+ The hashtags of some equipment have been changed.\n\n  \n* DFO Mission Improvements (Added with Live Server)\n+ Limited missions are added and appear in the rightmost column of DFO Daily Missions.\n\n  \n+ Every day at reset, all progress of limited missions will be reset.\n+ Limited missions cannot be changed and the rest bonus is not affected.\n+ All users are given the same limited mission.\n+ Depending on the level of the current character or the reputation of the adventurer, the mission content is the same, but the mission reward may vary.\n+ Rental equipment is excluded from the criteria for daily\/limited missions that appear for the first time after daily reset.\n+ The list of limited missions to be added is as follows.\n\n\n\n| Condition | Mission Details | Mission Rewards |\n| Level | Adventurer Fame | Daily MissionPoints | Golden Beryl | Ominous Crystal | ResonantOminous Crystal | Limited MissionClear Jar |\n| Level 110 Or Higher | 33,989 Or More | Clear 2 Random Area Dungeons 1 Time (Total 4 Times)\u203b Limited mission exampleClear the dungeon below- Clear White Land 1 time- Clear Vericollis 1 time- Clear Canyon Hill 1 time- Clear Queen Palt 1 time | 100 | 25 | 11 | 11 | 0 |\n| 32,523~33,988 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 11 | 0 |\n| 30,946~32,522 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 10 | 0 |\n| 29,369~30,945 | 100 | 15 | 9 | 10 | 0 |\n| 25,837~29,368 | 100 | 15 | 9 | 9 | 0 |\n| 23,259~25,836 | 100 | 15 | 8 | 9 | 0 |\n| 21,675~23,258 | 100 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 0 |\n| 13,195~21,674 | 100 | 10 | 7 | 8 | 0 |\n| 8,602~13,194 | 100 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 1 |\n| 4,176~8,601 | 100 | 0 | 6 | 6 | 0 |\n| Level 110 Or Higher | 0~4,175 | Appropriate Dungeon Clear 5 Times | 100 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 |\n| Level 100~109 | - | 100 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 |\n\n+ The rewards obtained when clearing daily missions are strengthened. Depending on the mission, different types and numbers of clear rewards are provided. Depending on the current character's level or adventurer's reputation, detailed mission details and mission rewards may vary.\n\n* Improved trigger options when attacking:\n+ Dev's Note: To solve such a problem, it has been improved so that the option is activated even when attacking independent object. However, in the case of the \"option to reduce the enemy's remaining HP\" in the process of improvement, it can inflict strong damage to the enemy even when the character is unable to fight. Therefore, we decided to keep it from being applied to independent objects. In addition, some job advancement has a balance problem due to excessive option activation, so the probability was adjusted separately for each job change and applied.\n+ Among character skills, independent object attacks are improved to be included in the activation conditions when attacking equipment items.\n+ Based on the number of independent objects that can be performed for each class, the probability of option activation when an independent object is attacked is adjusted and applied.\n+ However, the option to reduce the enemy's remaining HP when attacking is not applied.\n+ Activation options when attacking are added to the encyclopedia game terminology\n\n* Adjustment of neutralization gauge reduction efficiency:\n+ Dev's Note: Through specific equipment settings, all characters can have status abnormalities, and it has been confirmed that the efficiency of skills with high hit counts is too good. In addition to this, we are constantly discussing further improvements to the neutralization gauge system, and we are preparing improvements to make it even more fun.\n+ The effectiveness of the neutralization gauge reduction according to the number of hits per skill is adjusted\n\n* Other:\n+ Monster Encyclopedia - Achieved monster grade display is added to the inventory tab.\n+ Play Points - The display of free items is improved.\n+ The number of people entering the dungeon below will be changed from 4 to 2~4, and the pattern of some monsters will change according to the number of people.\n- The Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection\n- The Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum\n- Pandemonium War\n- Pandemonium War Hard\n- Black Purgatory Weekly Dungeon\n\n\nReferencesKDnF Test Server NoteKDnF Live Server Note  \nFixed-option Epic list -\u00a0GameChosun  \nEpic Translation by Yong\\*\n\n","163":"\n\n* As we all expected from Honey Time Event, all you need to do is log in, afk, and get rewards.

It also has 1 special dungeon Tower of Revelation, and 1 camp.\n+ The goal is to clear the main dungeon, Holy Land of Fear, in Crossroad of Terror. In order to enter Crossroad of Terror, you needs to clear the other 2 Crossroads first.\n+ Camp is where your character stay when not entering dungeons. Think of it like a waiting area\n+ Tower of Revelation is a special dungeon that spawns negative effects periodically every time it comes up. If the revelation occurs 3 times, the raid will reset.\n\n* Each Crossroad also has 4 sub-dungeons: Main, Liberation, Chaos, and Secondary.\n+ - Main dungeons: These will clear the crossroad\n+ - Liberation dungeons: You must clear this to enter the main dungeon\n+ - Chaos dungeons: This raises the chaos level of the raid (aka difficulty)\n+ - Secondary Dungeons: This provide buff effects for the raid when cleared.\n\n\n\nPhase 2 Operation Ellerinon: Second Coming of Chaos* Throne of Chaos, the goal is to clear this dungeon to complete the raid. It consists of 3 dungeons. The bosses in there share the same HP value, and the damage inflicted is shared. (just like Sirocco raid where you fight 3 forms)\n* Special Dungeon: City of Tragedy. Once cleared, you can force Ozma to enter a special state (Groggy???). You can only enter this dungeon once you have completed certain conditions.\n* Secondary Dungeon: Garden of Mirrors. Once cleared, it will increase recovery speeds for the people at camp, and also gives damage buffs for everyone. Someone must be fighting Ozma in Throne of Chaos for other party to enter this dungeon.  \n  \n\n\n\nRationale System\n\n* Think of this as your sanity level. Everyone will have their own gauge. This gauge reduces when hit with boss attacks. When it hits zero, you will lose your mind and start to threaten the other members. You can see everyone's gauges by the orange\/purple indicator underneath their party name.\n\n  \n* When your gauge hits zero, you will be teleported to a limbo place where you have to counter attack Ozma's illusion 3 times in order to regain your conscious mind and come back to reality.\n* If you fail to counter attack within the time limit in limbo, you die. If you success, you come back with your gauge turned purple and at 50%. If your purple gauge hit zero again, you die.\n* If everyone gauge in the party hit zero and they're in limbo at the same time, you lose the boss fight immediately.\n* This gauge can be further upgraded\/modified with sigil reward from Ozma raid through Black Earth Engraving System.\n\n\n\nBlack Earth Engraving System* The sigil you get from Ozma will look like the marks below.\n\n* They can be used to upgrade and activate Ozma raid's exclusive stat. Think of it as a way to improve your own Sanity Gauge and to \"gear\" yourself up for harder Ozma difficulty.\n\n* There are 3 type of sigils:\n+ Destruction Sigil: Increase Max Sanity Gauge\n+ Horror Sigil: Increase Max HP\n+ Despair Sigil Increase Damage when Sanity is below certain amount\n\n\n\nAuction System* Newly introduced system with Ozma Raid where players can place bit on the jackpot items. The higher the chaos difficulty level, the more items you can received to be auctioned.\n* Starting Price of 1mil or 3mil depending on the item.\u00a015 seconds to make a bid and timer resets after every bid.\u00a0\u00a0Each bid must be at least 5% higher than the current highest bid.\n* You see the list of auctionable items based on chaos level below:\n\n\u00a0\n\n| Difficulty | Auction Items |\n| Chaos Stage 1 | 1\/2 Random Dark Side's Sigil Box |\n| 2\/3 Pupil of Horror Box |\n| 3\/4 Deep Grudge Crystal Box (Account-Bound) |\n| 21\/22\/23 Grudge of Chaos Box |\n| Ozma Unique Card Album |\n| Ozma Legendary Card Album |\n| Foretold Destruction Jar |\n| Whisper of Despair Jar |\n| Random Ozma Epic Box |\n| Product of Corruption Jar |\n| Dark Product of Corruption Jar |\n| Purified Chaos Jar |\n| Vengeful Ozma of Chaos Bead |\n| Freed Kazan of Destruction Bead |\n| Chaos Stage 2 | 1\/2 Random Dark Side's Sigil Box (Account-Bound) |\n| Freed Kazan of Destruction Bead (Account Bound) |\n| 4\/5 Deep Grudge Crystal Box (Account-Bound) |\n| 28\/29\/30 Grudge of Chaos Box (Account-Bound) |\n| Ozma Unique Card Album |\n| Ozma Legendary Card Album |\n| Foretold Destruction Jar (Account-Bound) |\n| Whisper of Despair Jar (Account-Bound) |\n| Random Ozma Epic Box |\n| Product of Corruption Jar |\n| Dark Product of Corruption Jar |\n| Purified Chaos Jar (Account-Bound) |\n| Vengeful Ozma of Chaos Bead (Account-Bound) |\n| Freed Kazan of Destruction Bead (Account Bound) |\n| Chaos Stage 3 | 2 Random Dark Side's Sigil Box (Account-Bound) |\n| Freed Kazan of Destruction Bead (Account Bound) |\n| 6\/7 Deep Grudge Crystal Box (Account-Bound) |\n| 38\/39\/40 Grudge of Chaos Box (Account-Bound) |\n| Ozma Unique Card Album |\n| Ozma Legendary Card Album |\n| Foretold Destruction Jar (Account-Bound) |\n| Whisper of Despair Jar (Account-Bound) |\n| Random Ozma Epic Box |\n| Product of Corruption Jar |\n| Dark Product of Corruption Jar |\n| Purified Chaos Jar (Account-Bound) |\n| Vengeful Ozma of Chaos Bead (Account-Bound) |\n| Freed Kazan of Destruction Bead (Account Bound) |\n\n* Here're the detail description of each box\/jar:\n\n\n\n| Dark Side's Marking Box | Contain one of Destruction\/Despair\/Horror Sigils |\n| Deep Grudge Crystal Box | Contain Deep Grudge Crystal which can be used to purchase Selectable Sirocco Epic Box (30) |\n| Grudge of Chaos Box | Contain Grudge of Chaos (Ozma Raid's main material) |\n| Foretold Destruction Jar | Contain a random Shoulder\/Belt\/Shoes Ozma Epic |\n| Whisper of Despair Jar | Contain a random Necklace\/Magic Stone Ozma Epic |\n| Random Ozma Box | Contain a random Shoulder\/Belt\/Shoes\/Necklace\/Magic Stone Ozma Epic Box |\n| Product of Corruption Jar | Contain a random tradeable Product of Corruption Epic at 0 ~ 5 Modification Level |\n| Dark Product of Corruption Jar | Contain a random tradeable Product of Corruption Epic at 3 ~ 5 Modification Level |\n| Purified Chaos Jar | Contain a random Level 100 Mythic |\n| Vengeful Ozma of Chaos Bead | +30 All Elemental Damage Magic Stone Bead |\n| Freed Kazan of Destruction Bead | +100 STR\/INT\/VIT\/SPR Magic Stone Bead |\n\n  \n\n\nOzma Raid Rewards* Phase 1:\n+ Grudges of Chaos: 5 counts\n+ Grudges of Chaos: 6 counts\n\n* Phase 2:\n+ 200 Undaunted Determination\n+ For PC Bang\/VIP Premium: you get 3~4 more\n+ One of the following:\n- Grudges of Chaos: 16~19 counts\n- Grudges of Chaos: 26 counts\n- Grudges of Chaos: 16 counts + 1 of\n- Grudges of Chaos: 19 counts +\u00a0\u00a0Howling Grudge of Chaos: 19 counts (aka account bound version)\n- Grudges of Chaos: 16 counts + 1\u00a0\u00a0Ozma unique\/leg card\n- Grudges of Chaos: 16 counts + 1 Ozma Epic\n- Grudges of Chaos: 16 counts + 1 GoW Mythic\n\n\n\nChaos Difficulty Additional Reward* Clearing at higher difficulty, you get a chance at getting more cosmetic stuffs to show off with your friends.

You can watch the interview in this Youtube video.\n* This interview was about 3 hours long, and the author would like to express special thanks to u\/halfmango08 for the amazing translation.\n\nTable of Contents* First Half-Year Feedback\n+ Growth System\n+ Transfer\/Growth UI\n+ Neutralization System\n+ Character Balancing\n+ Gear Theme\n+ Level 110 Dungeons\n\n* Second Half-Year Roadmap\n+ June 30th (Multi-thread client improvement )\n+ July 7th (Ispins, Stormwrath, Dungeon & Life, Advanced Dungeons Improvement, Training Room Renewal)\n+ August \/ September (Character Renewal & Balancing, Bakal Raid)\n+ October (Advanced Dungeon Expansion, 16:9 widescreen, PVP season 8)\n+ November (Character Renewal \/ Balance, Archmage's Dimensional Corridor)\n+ December (Level 1~100 Scenarios Renewal)\n\n* Other Changes\n* Q&A\n* References\n\n\n\nFirst Half-Year Feedback* Growth System:\n+ The equipment level growth and transfer system itself was the first system introduced in Dungeon & Fighter, so we approached it too carefully. After much thought, the number of growth has increased more than tenfold since the update of the equipment growth system. He expressed his honest opinion, saying what would have happened if these changes had been corrected two to four weeks earlier.\n+ In addition, as an apology for having to rely on 'transfer growth' for equipment option levels at the beginning of the season, we are preparing a plan to calculate the golden beryl used for the 110 level transfer and refund 50% of the amount. It is at the stage of considering the payment method of beryl and promised to refund on July 17th.\n\n* Transfer\/Growth UI:\n+ Because the UI of the growth and transfer system was not intuitive, there were too many cases where precious enchantments such as reinforcement, amplification, and enchantment disappeared in one day by placing the material equipment and the equipment to be received in reverse.\n+ He had a policy of recovering as much as possible from such cases, but there were so many cases that the workload was overloaded. Accordingly, along with a major UI reorganization, the system will be improved so that equipment inheritance can be carried out at once.\n* Neutralization System:\n+ We plan to reorganize the \"neutralization system\" that harms the foundation between characters. He frankly stated that the system that reflects his greed was correct. He said that he wanted to revive the system that was alienated from the boss monster, which was armed with various defense conditions such as immunity to status abnormalities, impossible to hold, and invincibility in order to avoid situations where monsters were unilaterally hit.\n+ However, it is also true that the meta has changed rapidly after the maximum level expansion, and the actual dealing gap between characters who are well-adapted and those who are not is too large. It is difficult to directly adjust the character's balancing for each dungeon or item change, and it is difficult to directly modify the character's unique characteristics because it has to be respected.\n+ Therefore, the neutralization system itself is completely modified. It is reorganized so that the neutralization gauge can be cut even with a normal attack, and in the case of neutralization-type abnormalities, the gauge can be attacked regardless of weakness. In addition, he explained that he thinks that the neutralization state can play a similar role to the groggy time in the future, such as a significant decrease in the neutralization gauge when the monster's pattern is broken.\n\n* Character Balancing:\n+ Skill customizing gear such as talisman and decisive weapons have the merit of being creative and fun, but they also have the problem of characters being skewed when those gears disappear. As weapons would only last a season, they wanted to try something more bold and if necessary move some of its options to the characters via balancing. We realize this hasn\u2019t worked out, and we're sorry.\n+ In addition, they plan to raise the weapon options for classes with an excessively low use rate for Decisive Weapon, and downgrade the weapon options for some classes with too high use rates. The content will be updated as soon as July 7th.\n\n+ The character values \u200b\u200bthemselves are also partially adjusted. Asura, whose own performance is strong, will be slightly downgraded, and character balancing will be carried out for about 7 classes , including Troubleshooter, Male Ranger, and Dark Knight.\n+ Lower difficulties don\u2019t have enough buffers, higher difficulties don\u2019t have enough DPS. Dungeons cannot be balanced without buffers in account as they give so much dmg (almost 10 times with base buff, 20 times with 1a).\n+ This will be drastically reorganized so that you can feel the play experience equivalent to that of a dealer when playing solo. It is scheduled to be renewed in September, and until then, a cool-time reduction buff will be provided to the buffer group to supplement their solo play ability.\n\n* Gear Theme:\n+ It was also mentioned that only certain item combinations are being used. Reorganized to reduce the firepower gap between items. Representatively, the  Golem's Keystone Ring is a powerful piece of equipment that can be mixed with the Akan theme, and the  Unknown Golden Stone is reorganized as a cornerstone of the advanced level enhancement theme.\n+ Some setups (like sleep and petrification) have been designed with future contents such as Ispins and Bakal raid in mind, but obviously they haven\u2019t been able to serve the current meta and have been neglected.\n+ More gear balance incoming to completely revamp unused gears. Internal testing shows that many weaker setups will be vastly improved to be not far behind MP consume + ailment setup (current meta setup).\n\n* Level 110 Dungeons:\n+ Nassau forest is run vastly more than any other dungeon as its mobs have less HP than those of the other dungeons. Furthermore, the belt and shoes of the MP consume pieces also drop in Nassau. Dungeons will be nerfed\/rebalanced to reduce players\u2019 fatigue and alleviate this problem.\n+ Advanced dungeons improvement: golden beryls will be usable to buy the tickets to reduce reliance on burning through fp in normal dungeons to get play points. Tradable golden beryls will also drop guaranteed to stabilize the economy.\n+ Advanced dungeon expansion: Master difficulty will be updated in the future to improve its playability at the point where it starts lagging behind the legion dungeons. Tickets will have effects imbued that may improve rewards, buff players and enemies. Won\u2019t be a \u2018new\u2019 content that must be played.\n+ Meister's Lab: Was harder than it should\u2019ve been as they changed its design from a weekly dungeon to an advanced dungeon during development. Will be massively nerfed to better fit the position & let the players have their revenge.\n\n\nSecond Half-Year Roadmap\n\nJune 30th(Multi-thread client improvement ).embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n\nJuly 7th(Ispins, Stormwrath, Dungeon & Life, Advanced Dungeons Improvement, Training Room Renewal)* Legion Dungeon: Stolen Land, Ispins:\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }+ An adventurer who pursued Sirocco's thoughts meets the cruelest era in the history of the heavens. As the first Legion dungeon, it is a new advanced dungeon classification with strong named and 1:1 battles as the main, and potions and coin restrictions like raids.\n+ You can select a mission before starting a battle, and depending on this, you can get an advantage for monsters or for allies. You can also select the difficulty level in advance to increase the amount of rewards.\n\n+ The core rewards of Ispins Dungeon is the 'fusion system'. We focused on making the character stronger without compromising the existing equipment settings. In addition, in the dungeon reward, fusion equipment does not appear at all, and the \"Complete Price System\" is introduced, which can only be purchased by collecting materials.\n\n\u00a0+ A new fixed option Epic is also added. A powerful item that supports the previously neglected equipment theme is expected to appear. On the other hand, custom epics are not newly added, but instead, existing custom epic equipment appears with a higher probability.\n\n+ The entry system uses a system similar to the existing advanced dungeon, which allows you to enter a certain number of times per week rather than an admission ticket. Can enter as party. Solo mode available. Once a week per character.\n+ The difficulty level (requires 33,043 fames) is not much higher than that of the existing dungeons, but will consist around Meister's Laboratory expert and master level.\n\n* Stormwrath:\n+ Instead of a fixed number of entries per week, this dungeon consumes no play points, has good fatigue efficiency, and has a higher level of equipment options than other dungeons in the same class. The existing dungeon resources will be recycled as an 'intermediate dungeon', which means between a normal dungeon and an advanced dungeon.\n+ It consists of two difficulty levels of 12,000 and 25,000 fames, so it is a great help in advancing to advanced dungeons.\n\n* Dungeon & Life:\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }+ It is a place where you can take a breather from DFO, the traditional battlefield that grows villages by acquiring materials and building buildings through activities such as gathering, fishing, farming, and harvesting through Dungeon & Life. It will be updated on July 7th.\n+ Among them, you can also create consumables that help in battle. You can also play new content along with new consumables such as potions that restore allies or potions that cause status ailments.\n\n* Advance Dungeon Improvements:\n+ Advanced dungeon admission tickets are reorganized so that they can be purchased with Golden Beryl. Also, if you clear the advanced dungeon, there is a 100% chance to get a certain amount of Flawless Golden Beryl. An advanced dungeon card book will also be added so that you can continue to obtain financial benefits when playing advanced dungeons.\n\n* Improvement of Training Room:\n+ Completely revamp the training room, which is one way to measure damage. The type of monster and the battle situation can be created as an actual level 110 dungeon environment.\n+ The ability to retain the original enchantment, material, and equipment option level even if the equipment is replaced in the training room allows you to experience firsthand how powerful it will be in practice when new equipment is acquired\n\n* Neutralization System renewal, Golden Beryl sale Decisive\/Source Weapon adjustment also carried out in this date.\n* More improvement carried out on July 21th\n\n\n\nAugust\/September* Character Renewal & Balancing on August 4th. Bakal Raid Part 1 (weekly dungeon) on August 25th. Bakal Raid Part 2 (actual raid) on September 22nd\n* Bakal Raid, scheduled to be updated in August, will be added in two installments.\n+ Normal difficulty, 'Mechanical Revolution: Open War', can be challenged by 1 to 4 players, and is designed to be cleared more easily by adventurers who are difficult to challenge advanced difficulty or have difficulty in raid structure.\n+ The advanced difficulty, 'Mechanical Revolution: Bakal Raid' is a raid that deals with Bakal in earnest, and 12 people will challenge it together.\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }* Main reward:\u00a04 new weapons, 5 types of fusion armor, and 11 types of fixed optional epic equipment (one for each part) will be introduced. Convergence equipment can be acquired regardless of difficulty, so it will faithfully serve as a cornerstone for challenging advanced levels of difficulty.\n\n\nOctober(Advanced Dungeon Expansion, 16:9 widescreen, PVP season 8)* Advanced Dungeon Expansion:\n+ It is scheduled to be updated around October, and at that point, the equipment level is already high and the reason to return is lost. If you use an additional Lion Core to the existing Master Difficulty Ticket, it will be changed to an admission ticket with 4 enhancement options.\n+ Two reward enhancement effects, one character enhancement effect, and one monster enhancement effect are added, and of course, among the reward enhancement effects, there is a function that allows the equipment option level to appear at a higher level.\n\n* 16:9 Widescreen:\n+ Wide mode is officially supported, providing a wider screen that can be enjoyed in a PC environment. You can see a more detailed and majestic village, and even in the dungeon, colorful patterns and various elements of monsters that were not previously hidden or invisible appear, allowing you to experience a more lively dungeon.\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }* PVP Season 8:\n+ Introduces a system that can reverse the battle pattern by applying a powerful buff to the character when it enters below a certain HP. In addition, most of the skills that were not available for existing characters are unlocked, and blades and assaults are added as new characters.\n\n\nNovemberCharacter Renewal \/ Balance, \u00a0Archmage's Dimensional Corridor* Archmage's Dimensional Corridor:\n+ It is a content in which a group of adventurers who were traveling through the dimension after the battle with Bakal arrive at a place called the \"Library of Memory\", peering into their memories and passing through trials.\n+ Like Ispins, this is the second Legion dungeon with weekly entry counts. It appears on a lower difficulty level than the raid, and for users who have not yet entered the raid, it is possible to raise the equipment level, and for users who have already entered, it is being conceived as content that will help supply and demand goods.\n\n\n\nDecember(Level 1~100 Scenarios Renewal)* Whenever the maximum level is expanded, the story of Dungeon & Fighter is rearranged in such a way that it is added to the existing story. Even after reaching the highest level, the equipment and materials used are reorganized so that they can be obtained from level 1 instead of level 100, and the overall story breathing is also uniformly rearranged.\n\n\nOther Changes* Missions and Play Points:\n+ To reduce fatigue in general dungeons, the efficiency of limited missions will be greatly increased to reduce fatigue. Play points are also earned through missions rather than by consuming fatigue in regular dungeons. It allows you to acquire play points that were previously earned when you exhausted your fatigue in a day just by performing a mission.\n+ It solves the phenomenon that only specific dungeons run by allowing unique Epics obtained from general dungeons to be randomly dropped in advanced dungeons as well as from specific named\/bosses. In the case of Heroes Mode, we plan to reduce the HP increase for each difficulty level so that you can experience the feeling of becoming stronger.\n* Meister's Lab:\n+ Change the position to a dungeon that can be cleared more easily and has a good reward. Overall, the HP was lowered by 10% and the 12 o'clock room where I felt all kinds of negative experiences called 'Pork Cutlet Hammer', 'Identitate' dramatically reduces HP by about 80% so that I can pass easily.\n\n* Character Retouching:\n+ Seem like they're bringing the Dnf Mobile version to PC?\n\n* Custom Legendaries Improvement:\n+ Custom Legendaries will get an option reroll system, options can be rerolled a limited number of times. Reroll count will reset upon being resealed\n\n\n\nQ&A\u00a0* Should buffers farm multiple sets for buffing & damage after the revamp?\n+ No, they\u2019ll make sure the class & gears balancing will prevent this.\n\n* Will dungeon & life consumables be tradable?\n+ Yes they will be tradable.\n\n* +14 reinforce & +12 amp for clears kek.\n+ No, Bakal raid will never be balanced around amps\n\n* Farming custom epics is too hard.\n+ I agree, we\u2019ll eventually add more sources to farm it. If necessary we\u2019ll also consider and add new systems for it. Also they have no plans of adding new custom epics.\n\n* PVP arena too small.\n+ With 16:9 widescreen update they\u2019ll improve PVP visuals as well.\n\n* Male Slayer \/ Female Fighter new sprites when (DFO mobile sprites)\n+ They\u2019re working on it. There are a crapton of sprites so it\u2019s taking some effort, but they are working hard. Very hard. Probably next year. In case anyone asks: no it won\u2019t be some paid thing, it\u2019ll be an actual, free update.\n\n\nReferencesGameChosun  \nhalfmango's Summary  \n\n\n","166":"\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting Room\nozma\\_ready\\_01.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (July 12th).\n\nContent* LEVEL 110 CAP is here.

Since it's year of the Tiger, you get rewards related to that.\n+ KDnF version\u00a0event here.\n\n* DnF Duel Tournament - Just for DFO community\n+ This will be held for the Steam version of the game. Application open from July 12th to July 26th\n+ For viewers of the event, they will set up raffle to give out Steam code for the game (not sure how many). For contestants, you will get the limited rewards from back when you pre-order the game.\n\nSales* Hyperdimension Arad Package\u00a0(KDnF version here) along with Hyperdimension Pass\n* Mileage shop will be updated. Event\u00a0emblem selective box monthly sale using gold\n* Danji Pot system with new animation (Introduced by YJ, DFO Sale Designer)\n+ This is the system that will be replacing Lost Treasure. It is here to make it more friendly to luckly and unlucky players, and the main goal is to make sure there's a minimum return safeguard.\n+ Skeleton key will no longer available to purchase. Your existing keys will NOT expire, and you can convert them to Danji pot in Seria's room at conversion rate of 3 key to 1 pot. The reason being it takes 3 key to open 1 LT, where you only need 1 pot to open each pot. These Danji pot can be dropped in dungeon just like Skeleton Key.\n+ Originally with LR, you can only open 1 at the time. Here you can pick to open 1 time or 10 times.\n+ You can also select the Danji level, which relate the chance of the key items. Higher level will require more Danji pots to open (e.g. level 2 need 2 pots, level 3 needs 3 pots)\n+ New Danji Stack system also added. Each open will gain stack, and you get reward depends on your milestone. These stack rewards are NOT just one time. When you max the gauge, it resets and you can get rewards all over again. These stack rewards are TRADABLE. These stack rewards are seasonal and will be changed after a certain period (Some simple math here, 942 stacks will need 74,418 Cera, which is about $745 USD).\n\nOthers* N\/A\n\nQ&A* As adventurer\u2019s fame is extremely important next cap, will Neople be readjusting fame for certain items that have released in the past? For example, valhalla dps titles are still one of the best but have extremely low fame, as well as some sader creatures among other things\n+ Please send in tickets or report to CA, and we will handle it.\n\n* I'm a new player and I'm enjoying the game a lot. Fashion is a big deal to me and I love collecting outfits. I am somewhat saddened that some of the older fashion items like coin shop exclusive headgears can't be obtained anymore. Are there any plans to reintroduce these somehow?\n+ These hidden avatars will be included in the Danji pot system\n\n* Will we be getting the nerfed version of 110 cap with some QoL added on day 1, or is it going to be like KR on release?\n+ Yes, it's in our 110 cap update\n+ Personal Note: I'm not sure if this is true, Tigger probably meant \"soon\". Because (1) the required fame for Noblesse Code Master is\u00a029,361\u00a0in the promotion video, whereas KDnF QoL patch is\u00a023,788. (2) The mission UI is this\u00a0instead of QoL version.\n\n\n\n","169":"\n\n* This is a very simple event. You do your mission in game and collect coin so you can apply for lottery and win prices. I wish DFOG have this kind of event.\n\nLottery Entry* You can apply for an unlimited number of times each week, and the more you apply, the higher your chance of winning.\n+ For example, if you want the package, each application costs 200 coins, and you can apply 125 times, the more you apply, the higher change you can win it.\n+ Only gaming PCs can win only once during the entire event period.\n\nMissions* Blow is the list of repeatable missions and their rewards:\n+ Log in once a day (based on Seria room) - 30 coins\n+ Play the game (60 minutes) - 3 coins\n+ Clear optimal level dungeon (5 times) - 3 coins\n+ Advanced Dungeon Clear (1 time) - 30 coins\n+ Complete Daily Missions (4 times) - 10 coins\n+ Obtain Flawless Golden Beryl in advanced dungeons (40 counts) - 25 coins\n\n* And here is the list of weekly missions and their wards\n+ Clear the Storm's Wrath(5 times) - 100 coins\n+ Legion\/Raid Clear (3 times) - 3 coins\n\nLottery Items  \n  \nReferencesEvent Page  \nReward Page\n\n","170":"\n\n* Japan finally released their anniversary contents and sale.\n* Here I'll go over their events and what can you get from it.\n\nTable of Contents* Event\n+ Epic Road\n+ Airship Senki\n+ 15th Anniversary Special Gift\n+ 15th Anniversary Shop\n\n* Voyager Treasure Chest\n* Gamepad Controller\n* References\n\n\nEpic Road* Straight off the bat they give you 500 Time's Guide Stone.

It still drop\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and has higher chance of dropping epic mythic than regular Guide of Wisdom.\n+ The different is that it will consume 8 FP per run and require 27 Time's Guide Stone to enter.\n+ This dungeon has daily entry limit of 50 runs.\n\n\n\nAirship Senki* This is a very interesting event, it looks just like the\u00a0Arcade Fighter Online event DFOG are having right now, but instead of growing your village, you're growing a harbor.\n\n* You can trade goods like berries and wine. You can even buy, sell, upgrade your ship too.\n\n* Unlike\u00a0Arcade Fighter Online where you send adventures and they automatically go, here you need to actually control your ship with arrow key to explore the seven sea.\n\n* There will be object on the map that your ship can interact with like monsters, treasure chests, coin bags, etc. Here's a quick google translate.\n\n* You can complete daily mission to get event mat called \"Trade Certificate\".\n* Here's the list of accumulated mission.

These drop from doing optimal dungeons. You can get 60 coins per day. Below is the coin shop. The big items are the Selective Exile Mountain talisman box and 2 Fearsome Eyes.\n\n* The Firework looks like this\n\n  \n  \n\n\nVoyager Treasure Chest* This is a sale package. Think of this like the Lost Treasure 2.0 and you have the option of buying 1 box, 10 boxes, or 30 boxes pack.\n* Pretty simple, you can open the boxes one by one, or you can open 10 at the time.\n\n* When opening these boxes, you can get a small chance of getting an Amplification Box\u00a0. If you're unlucky, no worries, the gauge at the bottom will fill up as you opening boxes. When the gauge hit 100%, they give you the\u00a0\u00a0on your next box. This box has +10 ~ +12 Amp Tickets at various percent success rate (from 10% to 90%).\n\n* Please go to their official website\u00a0for the complete list of all available items in the RNG pool. Some of the most notable items are +13 Reinforce Ticket, +12 Amp Ticket, Epic Transfer Stone, and Rare Clone Avatar Set Box.\n* One of the items in this RNG pool is Voyage Coin . So if you're unlucky, at least you can rack up these Voyage Coins and buy the following item from the Coin shop. Pretty nice, you can get 2 Mythic Reroll Pot and 1 Epic Transfer Stone.\n\n* Here's the Buy-More-Win-More part, when you buy the 30-box pack, you get 1 Adventure Coin\u00a0\u00a0as bonus. And you can use this coin to buy the following. Bruh, Mythic Transfer Stone for 8 Adventure Coins.\n  \n\n\nGamepad Controller* They updated their internal controller interface. Bruh, it looks promising. It definitely doesn't match the complexity and functionality as third party program like xpadder. But if DFOG ever get it, I'll definitely try it.\n\n* Pros:\n+ Pre-built in, no need for 3rd party program like xpadder.\n+ It has basic options like creature skill, auction hall, skill window, main menu, etc.\n+ You can save up to 4 profiles.\n+ EasyDash option, you can dash with just ONE button (no need to double tap arrow).\n\n* Cons:\n+ Look like you can only register 7 skill keys at the time. But at least they include option where you can swap between row.\n  \n  \n\n\nReferenceshttps:\/\/arad.nexon.co.jp\/news\/update\\_view.aspx?no=12334\u00a0\n\n","171":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2452\/From-Zero-to-Sirocco?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","172":"\n\n* This update adds a new dungeon to the Valley of Fallen Souls area called Grave Tower.

I'm sure many people will grad Sirocco with these changes. I'll combining some of my duplicate pieces and hopefully I'll get something good. Good Luck!\n\n* Honey Time\n+ The daily 30 FP pot is very nice. The 20hr Time's Guide Stone box (200) is also nice.\n\n* From Zero to Sirocco!\n+ Not too bad for getting more end game materials.\n+ I suppose doing Guide Mode would work? The event page didn't mention.\n+ This is a 5-weeks event, and you can get up to 1,050 fragments for level 100 epic.

I'll run some numbers when we have this update in DFOG.\n\n* New Shop Option\n+ From Jun's Shop, you can buy 30\u00a0\u00a0with 80 \u00a0(unlimited purchases).

So in the beginning,\u00a0New Player! Start Here\u00a0page was created as an index page to quickly guide players through the game.\n* Looking back, although this page is useful, I thought it's a bit barebone. So I want to expand it to the next level through the inspiration of choco's blog.\n* When you look this blog page, it includes the most basic information about DFO for new players. Things like how to navigate UI, what are cubes, how to use auction hall, how to trade with other players, etc. So I want to make a page just like it and this page would eventually be where new players can go to to learn about the game.\n* This project will be called \"DFOlmanac\" which is a combination of DFO and Almanac (I thought it's a clever name).\n* What the heck is an Almanac? it's basically a guide for farmer that has lots of information to help them decide what and when to plant for the year. It has information like weather, moon phase, etc. So basically DFOlmanac will be a place that contain DFO most basic information to help you progress through the game. You get the idea.\n* The plan: When I have free time, I'll write simple and basic posts about the game. These posts will have [DFOlmanac] in the title and the \"Newbie Friendly\" tag. They will then be organized and indexed so new players can find everything on one page. In order to reduce cluster, these posts won't show up on \"Latest Articles\".\n\n\n\n","175":"\n\n* On September 15th, Japan released Agent 3A and Grave Tower.

Hovering the mouse over it will tell you how many point you have left.\n\n* Fatigue points determine how much you can play that particular character. Generally speaking each dungeon room will cost 1 FP. For example, if a dungeon has 4 rooms, it will cost you 4 FP to clear. When you're out of FP, you can no longer enter dungeon for that day. FP will reset each day.\n* Some exceptions:\n+ With level 100 cap, some dungeons will cost a fix amount of FP regardless of how many room you clear. E.g. Ghent Palace, Basement of Pain, Black Shrine, etc.\n+ Raid dungeons will not cost any FP. E.g. Fiend War, Prey, Sirocco Raids.\n+ Some dungeons don't require any FP at all to enter. E.g. Valley of Fallen Souls area.\n\nGet More FP* The biggest way to increase FP per character is to purchase Neo Premium Contract. It's located under \"Premiums\" tab. This contact will increase your default 156 FP to 272 FP, which is a huge boost. The best part is that this increase is for every character in the account.\n* For a 30 days contract, it will cost you about $10.\n* NOTE: If you get the contract, you will have an option to turn on \"FP Express\", which burn FP twice as fast but give you twice as much EXP. Do NOT turn this on. The majority of your EXP for leveling is from completing quests, which this function does not increase. So the more FP you have, the more quests you can complete, the faster you can level up.\n\n* Beside contract, another way to increase FP is through FP pot. This generic point can be crafted through Alchemy profession. Most people buy them from Auction Hall.\n* You can only use 1 pot per character per day. Each pot will recover 30 FP.\n\n* Sometimes Neople releases packages what have FP pot as bonus as well. So watch out for those.\n\n  \nThe Problem With FP* The biggest problem is that Fatigue Point hinder new players from playing more on their first day. DFO only allows you to create 2 characters per day. For a 156 FP bar, it will take about 1 hour or so to burn through.\n* So without any FP pot, on the 1st day, new players probably can only play about 2-3 hours.\n* If you're a new player reading this post. Please don't let this kill your game experience. I can assure you that when you get to max level and closer to end game, FP won't be a problem at all. This game highly encourage you to play multiple characters. The more characters you have, the better funneling you can do.\n* Just look at the first page of my character screen, I barely have time in the day to play all of them.\n\n\n","178":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/pg\/qlipha2021?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","179":"\n\n* This small patch only include a few small things. The developer has noticed that some end game contents have cube gimmicks that prevent you from using skills that consume clear cubes. Therefore they add a small QoL to the following buff skills so they will no longer consume clear cubes.\n+ Male Nen Master:\u00a0\u00a0Tiger Flash\n+ Female Nen Master:\u00a0\u00a0Tiger Flash: Nen Creature of Light\n+ Elementalist:\u00a0\u00a0Transcendence Rune\n+ Kunoichi:\u00a0\u00a0Ninpou: Shadow Clone\n\n* Sharman got a small QoL for\u00a0\u00a0One Hundred Eight Beads.\u00a0The skill key input time required to cast the wide-area explosion version is reduced.\n\n* Now to the good part.

Here I will explain how it works in simple terms.\n\nWhy Retexture?* There are 5 armor types in this game: Cloth, Leather, Light, Heavy, and Plate. Why can't we just use whatever drop? It's because classes have their own Armor mastery, which gives extra stats when you wear appropriate type.\n* Armor Master is a passive skill that learned when you start to change to your subclass. In the example below, when Male Gunner become Male Ranger, he gets Leather Armor Mastery.\n* So when a Male Ranger equip a leather armor, he gets extra stats. Below is the description of the passive. In total, by wearing all 5 leather armors, you can get up to 316 Strength and 15% Critical Chance. Simple damage gains for not a lot of work.\n\nHow to Retexture?* First, walk to NPC Roger Levin in West Coast, talk to him and select \"Retexture\". NPC Strawberry Nose Della in Black Market can also retexture as well.\n\n* After that, simply put in the armor piece you want to retexture, select the type of armor you want to convert into (it will ask you for some materials), then click \"Retexture\". That's it, super easy.\n\n* Each retexture, depending on the armor type, will ask for 500,000 gold, 1 legendary soul, and 80 Superior material (leather, cloth, bone, stone, or iron). These leather, cloth, bone, stone, or iron materials can be easily found through dungeon runs. Pretty much all mobs can drop these.\n\n\n\n\n","182":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2501\/Destruction-and-Chaos?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","183":"\n\n* This patch, Japan made a dual release of Ozma Raid along with the rest of the 3rd Awakening.\n* Here I summarize the patch along with its events.\n\nPatch Summary* Ozma raid is released along with everything that go with it.

Here I will simplify the effect of each set along with their pros and cons to help you pick which set is best for you.\n* I don't play Sader and Aeterna much, so this post will mostly cater to DPS and Synergies. But for your reference, I'll put the stat summary and comments for Sader and Aeterna at the end.\n\nTable of Contents* Why Read This?\n* For DPS \/ Syn\n+ Tiamat Set Summary\n+ Astaros Set Summary\n+ Rosenbach Set Summary\n+ Berias Set Summary\n+ Redmayne Set Summary\n+ Combination Example\n+ Summary\n\n* For Saders\n* For Aeterna\n* References\n\n\n\nWhy Read This?* Well, with Ozma raid, you get 5 sets, each contain 5 pieces, to fuse with your Shoulder, Shoe, Belt, Necklace, and Magic Stone.\n* On top of that, each Ozma set has set option of 2-set, 3-set, or 5-set. So as you can see, just like level 100 epics, you can mix match multiple Ozma set to your liking.\n* AND on top of that, Ozma has reroll option where you can add unwanted pieces and filter out what you want. So eventually, with enough effort, you can get any Ozma pieces you want.\n* NOTE: Your Ozma reroll will reset if you collect the item. So you\u2019ll have to do it all in one go to get the exact piece you want.\n\n* NOTE: There are some RNG involved with Ozma Epic. Each Ozma piece will have a grade (Blue, Purple, Yellow). Each grade will provide different \"Special Option\" stat and there's no way to reset them (you will have to hope for another dup with higher stat).\n+ For example, Tiamat Shoulder that provide \"Level 45 skill consume (9 \/ 7 \/ 5%) HP\". That means if you get a blue version, the skill will consume 5%, purple version consumes 7%, and so on.\n\n\nFor DPS \/ Syn\n\nTiamat Set Summary* Pros: This set has\u00a01% higher modifier from the \"Simple Option\" than other set. Especially with the Shoes piece, it has 2% higher total modifier (1% higher Additional Attack and 1% higher Bonus Damage).\n* Cons: Every time you cast a certain skill, you lose 5-9% HP. The cooldown is 10% but this can be a problem especially during longer fight or when you have lots of CDR gears.\n* Good News: At 3-set option, the HP reduced is cut down by\u00a05%. So now instead of losing 9\/7\/5%, you will lose 4\/2\/0% instead, which is great.\n* Overall:\n+ If you want to get this set, the Shoes is a must.\n+ Try to get 3-set option to get the reduced penalty.\n+ Mix with other set that have utility.\n\n\nAstaros Set Summary* Pros: Huge skill level increases the more pieces you wear.\n+ With the 2-set option, you can type \"Past\" to activate that dimension. Think about if you get 2-piece of yellow version, you can activate +2 levels to skill 70, 75, and 80. Which is a huge damage increase.\n\n* Cons: Highly RNG and you don't always get the version of the skill range you want.\n* Overall: This set is very good if you know what skill range you want to activate.\n+ It's also hard to make a recommendation because every class has different skills, but generally higher level skill like 70 75 and 80 do a lot more damage.\n+ If you want to use this, I would get at either 2-set or 3-set option (maybe 3 Tiamat\u00a0piece and 2 Astaros piece)\n\n\n\nRosenbach Set Summary* Pros: Great utility set that give you a shield (20% of Max HP) and give you various buff if you get hit with the active shield. The 2-set option is great, increasing 1% HP\/MP every 1 second.\n* Cons: Nothing really.\n* Overall: Best with 2-set utility option. Highly recommend the belt for movement speed.\n\n\nBerias Set Summary* The pieces give you a soul (Max Stacks: 1, Soul perish after 5 hits, Hit Cooldown: 2 seconds, Soul Respawn Cooltime: 20 seconds) on top of your character that give you buff.\n* Pros: Great utility set like\u00a0Rosenbach. The buff effects are great.\n+ With 2-set option, you can increase hit limit to 6 and reduced Soul Respawn cooltime to 15 second.\n+ Unlike Rosenback set where you have to get it to get buff, this set gives you buff right at the start.\n\n* Cons: The set options fall short after 2-set.\n* Overall: Good utility options. The Necklace is the only Ozma piece that give both Attack and Casting Speed.\n\n\n\nRedmayne Set Summary* Pros: Decrease skill cooldown by 10%, which can go great with other CDR strategy like Mind Stim Potion and Sirocco's Assassin Set.\n* Cons: Decrease your max HP\/MP by a huge amount.\n* Overall: Great set.\u00a0I would check how much CDR you have and weight your risk\/benefit from there.\n\n\n\nCombination Example* 3\u00a0Tiamat (higher modifier) + 2\u00a0Redmayne (more CDR):\n+ Remember to get Tiamat Shoe for the 2% higher modifier.\n+ This combination is good if you already have epic set that already give utility (e.g. Crossroad set)\n\n* 3 Tiamat (higher modifier) + 2 Rosenbach or 2 Berias:\n+ If you don't have a lot of utility, this is a good combination.\n+ If you don't care about the 3-set\u00a0Tiamat that reduces the HP penalty, you can replace it with\u00a0Berias belt to make up for those HP lost.\n\n\nSummary for DPS\/Syn* Tiamat Set - Higher overall modifier, but comes with HP penalty.\n* Astaros Set - Increase skill level at a rotation, comes with no penalty.\n* Rosenbach Set - Create HP shield, gives buffs when you got hit.\n* Berias Set - Give buffs right off the bat, and wears off after certain number of hit.\n* Redmayne Set - Reduce skill cooldown, but comes with reduce max HP\/MP penalty.\n\n\n\nFor SadersTiamat Set Summary* Definitely has the strongest buff power, but doesn't provide any additional benefit through healing, resurrections, etc. (perhaps you can use this a swap set)\n* If you're playing Enchantress, note that wearing all 5-piece will reduce Black Forest Barrier from 5 sec to 3 sec.\nAstaros Set Summary* Buff power is quite low compared to other. It offers no special benefit or penalty.\nRosenbach Set Summary* Overall great balanced set. Buff power is not the highest, but provides huge additional benefits through special option. I fell like most sader would go with this set.\n* Note that the barrier her is 5% of Max HP as compared to 20% for DPS\/Syn.\nBerias Set Summary* This set only increase stat through passive skills, and doesn't add any buff power to level 30 and 50 skills.\nRedmayne Set Summary* Overall about the same power as Astaros set, although comes will penalty in healing skills.\n\n\nFor AeternaTiamat Set Summary* For simple option, you get total of 1,550 stat increase right of the bat.\n* In addition to special option (assuming you cast all the required skills to proc the effect), you get another 1,250 stat, for a total whopping 2,800 stat. This set by far will provide the most stat.\n\nAstaros Set Summary* For simple option (just like Tiamat), you get total of 1,550 stat increase.\n* The special option is RNG though, you get additional 375, 625, or 875 stat for a total of 1,925 or 2,175 or 2,425 stat.\n* As you can see, the total buff is not as strong as Tiamat and has RNG involved.\n\nRosenbach Set Summary* For simple option (just like Tiamat), you get total of 1,550 stat increase.\n* For special option, it's pretty bad. Here you only get additional 100 stat. So I don't recommend using this set at all.\n\nBerias Set Summary* For simple option (just like Tiamat), you get total of 1,550 stat increase.\n* This set definitely gives you huge attack movement casting speed. But again, it only provide additional 100 stat through special option.\nRedmayne Set Summary* Unlike other sets, this one gives you 1,675 stat through simple option.\n* It gives you the highest simple option stat, but fails to provide any additional stat through special option.\n\nSummary for Aeterna* Tiamat Set - Higher overall party effects, but comes with HP penalty.\n* Astaros Set - 2nd highest party effects, but comes with RNG.\n* Rosenbach Set - Bad party effect, but high survival with the shield.\n* Berias Set - Bad party effect, but gives huge attack movement casting speed.\n* Redmayne Set - 3rd highest party effects, gives total 900 px party effect, but comes with HP\/MP penalty.\n\n\nReferencesNamu Wiki  \nNaver -\u00a0Let's Fuse Ozma Epics  \nDunpa Cast -\u00a0Ozma Equip Summary  \nChangelog* 1\/2\/2022:\n+ Changed icons for Magic Stone slots for Rosenbach and\u00a0Redmayne pictures.\n\n* 12\/17\/2021:\n+ Added clarification on Ozma reroll system\n\n* 11\/15\/2021:\n+ Edited images to match DFOG version\n+ Added Sader comments\n+ Added Aeterna options and recommendation\n\n\n","185":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2517\/The-End-of-Neo-Awakenings?page=1  \n  \n\n\n","186":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2516\/Auto-terna?page=1  \n  \n\n\n","187":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2521\/Master-of-Ozma-Raid?page=1  \n  \n  \n\n\n","188":"\n\n* DFO ExStream is a traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (Nov. 9th).\n* The user\u00a0u\/Princess\\_Everdeen\u00a0has stepped down from writing confirmation\u00a0for us.

And with the Farming QoL Improvement coming up on the horizon, there're now even more ways to funnel your resources.\n* Do you want to learn how to funnel? In this article, I will show you the many ways to can gear up your alt from Zero to Hero.\n\nGeneral Information* Before we start, this\u00a0Equipment Farming Improvements\u00a0will be your main farming method. Basically all the character bound materials in level 100 cap will now have their account-bound version. As you can see, the more alts you have, the faster you can gear up another character..\n\nWeapon* Grave Tower is an option if you have highly geared characters. You can register up to 6 characters per week to gather Old Golden Coins, then use them to buy the weapon type of your choice. Since there are 2 level 100 weapon for each type, here you have 50% chance of getting the weapon you want.\n* Hard Oculus is another option. You can get this Random Weapon box once per month per character, and it's account-bound. The sad thing is that pot is randomized based on the base class (slayer, gunner, mage, etc.)\n\n* Pit of Incarceration 3,4,5 also give mat to buy weapon pot. Unfortunately, the pool for this pot is very big. For example, if you're female fighter, it will give you a random weapon among all the fighter weapon type.\n\n* If you need to refine the weapon,\u00a0Powerful Energy Improvements\u00a0added account-bound version to fit your needs.\n+ Clearing Roschest legendary dungeon will give you account-bound Refined Powerful Energy\u00a0.\n+ You can also buy\u00a0\u00a0through NPC Jun using\u00a0\u00a0and buy from Raid shop using\u00a0.\n\nEquipment* With the improvement patch, you can now upgrade level 100 legendary to pre-selected level 100 epic sets (Mother Nature, Elementalist, Synchro sets). Legendary to Epic needs 2,000\u00a0\u00a0and 100\u00a0.\n+ For 3+3 dungeon,\u00a0\u00a0reward multiplied by 1.5 times. 50% of\u00a0\u00a0will be given out as\u00a0. The cost of legendary equipment is reduced to 600\u00a0\u00a0each. Looking at the\u00a0data from my 3+3 runs, each character can get you 60\u00a0. So doing 3+3 total\u00a010 times\u00a0will give you enough account-bound mat to buy 1 legendary slot.\n+ For 2+2 dungeon,\u00a0\u00a0reward multiplied by 2 times. 50% of\u00a0\u00a0will be given out as\u00a0. Looking at the data from by 2+2 run, each character can get you about 61\u00a0. So doing 2+2 total 361 times\u00a0will get you enough account-bound mat to upgrade all 11 slots. Also remember that Oculus also give\u00a0. I have 25 characters that can do 2+2, so it will take me like 2 weeks to get this done.\n\n* Random Epic Pots are your friends. They're available from NPC Dorothy and NPC Robato. They are character bound, but the materials needed to buy them comes in account-bound version (\u00a0and\u00a0). So the more 2+2 and Oculus you do, the more you can buy these pots.\n+ From the Sirocco Challenge shop, you can get another random pot per week.\n+ Also, DON'T forget your Oculus Ditto\u00a0and your random epic pot from Night of Revelation too.\n\n* Recycle unwanted epics\u00a0from all your random pots. The \"Chest of Immateriality\" from Sirocco Challenge shop is a good option. In addition, with\u00a0KDnF's Sirocco Hard mode, you can buy 2 Chests per character per week with\u00a0.\n\n* Last option for your desperate needs. If there's an epic piece you really need to complete the set-up, beside transferring the piece from another character, you can buy the epic fragments from Sirocco and Ozma raid shop. Each of these boxes will give you 50 fragments.\n\n  \nMythic* Really the only way you can funnel this is through transferring from another character. Mythic\u00a0 can be dissembled and will give 1 Light of Wisdom\n* Transferring Mythic will need the following materials. You will need 630 Elemental Crystal for earring slot instead of 420.\n  \n* Want to reroll specific Mythic line? Sirocco Hard mode got chu. You can buy up to 2 mythic kaleido boxes per character per week.\n\nBlack Purgatory Mods* Reward Improvements\u00a0were added so you can buy Ore of Despair Box\u00a0\u00a0from auction hall if needed. They also added Fearsome Eye box\u00a0\u00a0that let you get 2 eyes per week guaranteed.\n* Mods Improvements\u00a0were added so you can inherit the mod to another piece of the same slot and change the type of mods too. As you can see, the more BP daily \/ weekly you do, the more Ore you can funnel.\n  \nSirocco Pieces* The Sirocco weapon is easy, you can just funnel 220 petals for that.\n* The \"Liberated Subconscious Pot\" is your friend. The more Sirocco you do, the more Account-bound\u00a0\u00a0you can funnel.\n* The \"Chest of Circulation\" will allow you to recycle unwanted Sirocco pieces.\n* If you still can't get the piece you want, Ozma raid has Selective Sirocco box you can buy for the cost of 30 Saturated Grudge Crystal. Beside doing Ozma raid, you can get this crystal through\u00a0Sirocco Hard Mode\u00a0(up to 2 crystals per week per character). Really between this box and Sirocco Ditto, you will grad in no time.\n\n  \nOzma Pieces* This part is very straight forward, the only way you can get the pieces you want is to open the \"Sleeping Terror Pot\", then use the \"Holy Grail of Faith\" system to filter out the pieces.\n  \nTalismans and Runes* Forget about the RNG with this system. The\u00a0Runes \/ Talisman Improvements\u00a0made it so that you can purchase unlimited \"Capella Talisman Selective Box\"\n* As you can see, doing enough Exile Mountain will get you enough account-bound\u00a0\u00a0to get any talismans and runes you want.\n  \nSwap Set* Operation Hope\u00a0changes make it super easy.\u00a0\u00a0will be given out as\u00a0, so farm this as much as your heart desires.\n* S Recipe will have 100% success rate, and Abyss Fragment's purchase limit removed.\n\nWooHoo* There you have it. That's pretty much all the different ways I can think of to help you funnel and gear up your alts. As always, if I'm missing any other ways, let me know!\n\n\n","191":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2542\/Lucky-Black-Friday?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","192":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2515\/Spectre-Preview?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","193":"\n\n\n\n\n\nDungeon\nmirkwood.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

In Global version, this is called Arcade Legend Online.\n* Here I will summarize the event, provide some tips and tricks, along with material tables and quest guide. Curtesy of wonderful KDnF Casters.\n\nTable of Contents* General Information\n* Reward Shop\n* Tips and Tricks\n* Material Tables\n+ Building Upgrade\n+ Linus Weapon Shop\n+ Hill's Armor Shop\n+ Gina's Accessory Shop\n+ Danjin's Special Equipment Shop\n+ Loton's Material Shop\n+ Canna's Crafting Shop\n+ Hekate's Souvenir Shop\n+ Regional Boss Drop Equipment\n+ Secretive Tree - Weapon Combination\n+ Sharan's Armor Combination Shop\n+ Ferris' Special Equipment - Combination Shop\n+ Secret Moonlight Tavern - Special Material Combination\n\n* Quest Guide\n* References\n\n\n\nGeneral Information* This sequel uses the same concept as the original. In this edition, instead of raising multiple characters and have no control over where they go, you now control the character.\n* In a nutshell, you collect materials, craft stuff, then clear higher level dungeon. Ya know, basically like every MMORPG out there.\n\n* (1) This is your character info bar. It include info like gold, HP, potion, and Fatigue points.\n* (2) Alert center. It basically notify you when something new is available\n* (3) Mini-map\n* (4) Your character. You can use the arrow keys to walk around.\n* (5) Tool bar, include things like character info, inventory, achievement, etc.\n\n* This part is very self explanatory. This is basically your character info, where you can see level, equipment, stat, etc.\n* That's basically it, you kill stuff, gather stuff, kill daily boss, unlock more regions. One thing to note is that in this version, you don't really build anything. All the building already placed on your town, so you will need to upgrade them to be able to buy stronger equip.\n\n\n\nReward Shop* The currency is called Bit Fragment, and you can get them through completing daily and achievement within the mini-game.\n* The shop is not bad, some of the notable ones are:\n+ Sirocco Set Box: you select a set and it spits out a random piece of that set.\n+ Selective Level 100 epic equipment box.\n+ Selective Level 100 epic weapon box.\n+ Time's Guide Stone box (100 count): You can buy 2 boxes per week and it's a 6-week event, so basically free 1,200 TSG.\n+ Cosmetic like Face and Weapon avatar\n\n* In the Japanese\u00a0version of the event, they also give you cosmetic\u00a0bubble head, pets and emotes as well.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nTips and Tricks* The goblin attack speed is quite slow, so you can actually use the hit-n-run strategy. From the look of it, doing it horizontally seems to work better.\n* Each region boss appear once per day.\n* The Wooden Club from Souvenir Shop is a good starter weapon. It has 100 attack, which is stronger that the default weapon they give you. It has level 1 requirement so you can just equip right the way.\n\n* Right at the beginning, talk to Seria to complete a series of question. When done she will give you a Cosmic Soul, which you can use to upgrade the\u00a0Souvenir Shop to level 2. Then you can buy \"Faded Emerald Ring\" which adds 435 HP and 15 movement speed (very helpful in early game).\n\n* When you're out of HP, drink from the village pond to recover.\n\n* If you don't want to manually hunt, you can put your character in auto-drive. It will take about 20 minutes to burn through 156 FP bar. If you were doing it manually, each mob kill will cost 3 FP.\n\n* The level 1 Chestplate is another good early game purchase from the Armor Shop. It cost 1,800 gold and has 48 defense.\n\n* Treasure chests are your friend. Each one is 500 gold and the estimated location are as below. The chests (red circles) will reset daily. The Blue Circles and Gray Squares are locations for quests which I'll cover later on.\n\n  \n\n\nMaterial Tables* You can get the following materials from mob drops based on the region levels.\n\n\n\n| Area | Icon | Material Name | Dropped By | Sell Price(Gold) |\n| Grand Flores(Level 1~25) | Starting |  | Goblin Leather | Arcade Goblin | 68 |\n| Midway |  | Kinoll's Lightning

Here I'll summarize what is needed so you can get the Mythic of your choice.\n\nHow Many Stones* From the Event page, each stone will let you filter out 1 mythic that you don't want. The best part is your selection will be saved when you use the next stone. There 35 Mythic in the game, so in theory you will need 34 stones to get the Mythic of your choice.\n* Is it really possible to get 34 stones? I'm not sure. But from\u00a0this video, he used 34 stones to get the Annunciation Mythic from KDnF Blade events.\n\nHow to Get 34 Stones\n\n* Let's do some math to see if it's possible. Right off the bat, by hitting training level 10, you get 6\u00a0stones. So make sure you farm those event dungeons to level up.\n\n* Next is from leveling to 100. You will get 3 stones (1 from level 95 and 2 from level 100). Now you have 9 stones.\n\n* Next is from Posia's shop, you can get 1 stone every week for 8 weeks. Now you have 17 stones. You will need to get 2,000 Stectre Tokens for those 8 stones. I found that a good way to get those is to dissemble those \"S\" equipment dropped from the event dungeons.\n\n* To get the remaining stones, they have to come from \"Path of the Spectre\" event. From looking at all the path, you can get another 5\u00a0stones. Now you have 22.\n\n* To get the remaining 12 stones, you can get them from buying the repeatable box at the end of the path.\n\n* In order to buy everything from this path without getting the last box, you will need\u00a021,600 RP. Since each repeatable last box cost 2,000 RP, in order to get 12 stones and clear out the whole path, you will need total of 45,600 RP.\nHow to Get RP Points* Once you hit level 100 on Spectre, you can gain RP points from clearing end-game dungeons. Your first source is \"Hall of Experience\" and they can only done once. You can earn total 4,150 RP here.\n\n* The next source is \"Hall of Exploration\" and they can be done respectively. If my math is correct, you can get up to 4,750 RP per week\u00a0 assuming:\n+ You clear all your daily dungeon everyday.\n+ You clear Oculus, Exile, and Black Purgatory 3 times per week.\n+ You clear Prey, Sirocco, and Ozma 2 times per week.\n\n* Since this is an 8-week events, you can get up to\u00a038,000 RP\u00a0totally.\n* So if you complete both hall, you can only get 42,150 RP, which is nowhere close to\u00a045,600 RP to clear out the path and buy all the repeatable stones.\n* To make up for the 3,450 RP short, you can clear daily dungeon repetitively through the \"Hall of Exploration\". I would recommend farming the \"Spectre Event Dungeon\" because they drop epics, talisman, BP mat, etc. Each run gives you 15 RP, so you just need to do 230 runs over the course of 8 weeks to get all the benefit from this event (which is about 5\u00a0runs per day everyday).\n\nWhich Mythic Should I Get* One of DFOG Content Creator has done a video about this topic, you can watch it here. You can also use this\u00a0https:\/\/apps.dfcat.net\/regiondungeon\/ to specifically farm for the epic piece you want.\n\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \nChangelog  \n* 12\/5\/2021: You get 3 extra stones from leveling, the RP calculation has been adjust to reflect these changes.\n\n\n\n","204":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","205":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","206":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","207":"\n\n* As stated in the Exstream confirmation, DFOG will get full Farming Improvement Update. With this patch, Ghent will yield more Token and the cost for Unique gears will be reduced. Here I'll do some quick math to see how much gold you can earn from here.\n\nWhat QoL* Each run will now yield x1.5 times more Token, AND Ghent unique gears (including weapon) will have the cost reduction from 600 to 400 Tokens. Basically you can buy more Weapon to resell. These heavy bulk weapon (e.g. Zan, Cannon) can be sold for almost 30k gold each.\n* If you didn't know, KDnF daily reward count is 6 per day, and DFOG is 20 per day.\n\n  \nQuick Math* Belows are some of the data I have gathered for my previous comparison, using Aiolite price of 4,183 gold. Each of the data row is 20 runs.\n  \n* If Ghent get the QoL Patch:\n+ For 20 runs, your average Token earning will goes from\u00a05,589 \u2192 8,383.5\n+ Which mean you can buy 20.9 weapons to resell, which give you about 625,997 gold.\n+ Add that to your average raw gold earning\u00a0609,727 will give 1,235,723\n\n* Compare that to Stormy Route average 20 runs:\n+ 1,235,723 (Ghent) vs.\u00a0983,771 (Stormy), that's about 25.6% better and Ghent really require no gear to clear\n\nWhat about Roschest* Well, from my data, Roschest gives 1,260,294 gold per 20 runs. Using\u00a016,600 as Time Crystal price.\n* If we get Ghent QoL, 20 runs can give\u00a01,235,723 gold, that's a 1.98% different. Literally Ghent will become the BEST GOLD FARMING\u00a0spot.\n* This would have huge impact on the game's economy for our server. Because why would I gear up 12\/12 to farm Roschest where I can just farm Ghent in Unique gears that I can obtain in like 1 day? I'm sure farming bot would love this.\n* Again, these are just in theory. If we actually get it, I'll definitely run some number.\n\n\n","208":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","209":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","210":"\n\n* DFO ExStream is a traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (Dec. 7th).\n\nContent* Watcher in the Rift\u00a0(aka Watcher of Crack)\n+ Basically GoW 2.0.\u00a0It is designed so that you can acquire not only the epic\/mythical equipment acquired in the guide of wisdom, but also the sirocco epic equipment.\n+ Clear Watcher to gather Watchful Energy Light then enter Guide of Extinction to get your guarantee epic.\n+ Full KDnF note here.\n\n* Farming Improvement Update\n+ Full QoL update.

Here's a quick summary of potion, how to get them, and which one to use.\n\nImportant* For potions that recover HP and MP, they often share cooldown. So make sure you go to the training center to see which one share cooldown with which one.\n* In the example below, Heavenly HP potion and Canna's Homemade Bread share the same cooldown because they both recover 30% HP.\n\n* However, Canna's Homemade Bread doesn't share cooldown with Adventure Recovery potion even though both restore 30% HP because they have different description.\n\nHow to Get* Buy from Cera Shop, they can be found under \"Item\" tab and \"Dungeon\" sub-tab. While they get the job done, I highly recommend you NOT get potion from here. There're other ways.\n* From Neo Premium Vending Machine, her you use Neo Premium Token to as RNG slot machine. Often time you get lots of good potion. The down side is that these Tokens only drop in dungeons if you have Neo Premium Contract (which cost about $10 USD per month).\n\n* From Arad Adventure system, this is a new mini-game added with Sirocco raid. While doing your adventure dungeons, you can encounter Gabriel's shop where you buy Mystery box from him. At the end of each month, I gather about 100-200 Recover Potions from this method.\n\n* From events, Neople continuously give out free potions using event currency. So watch out for those. Here's an example.\n\n* From Alchemy crafting, which is a profession that dedicate to making potions. DFO Wiki has a good page about this topic.\n\nWhich One to Use* Beside the HP \/ MP potions, there are other ones that give you huge boost. The following are commonly used by veterans in end-game dungeons and raids.\n+ Warlord's Cry Potion: Attack damage +12% for 60 seconds\n+ Mind Stimulant Potion:\u00a0Reduces the cooldown of all skills by 20% for 10 minutes.\n+ Undiluted Strength Potion: Boosts Strength by 175 for 30 minutes\n+ Undiluted Intelligence\u00a0Potion: Boosts Intelligence\u00a0by 175 for 30 minutes\n+ Undiluted Vital Potion:\u00a0Max HP will increase by 1850 for 30 minutes\n+ Undiluted Mana Nostrum: Max MP will increase by 1465 for 30 minutes\n\n* Other non-dungeon potions that often used are:\n+ Reinforcement Proficiency Formula:\u00a0Increases your Reinforcement Success Rate for 30 minutes.\n+ Elixir of Fatigue Recovery:\u00a0Recovers Your Fatigue Level by 30.

I'm not sure how it will work with Global version, so we'll have to wait to see.\n  \n\n\n5th Male Gunner* This new subclass is called Assault. Definitely looks like a cyborg with tons of technology. Damage type and weapon type are unknown. You can watch the trailer below.\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n\nSynergy Class Removal* The director stated that all synergy will receive 8.5% buffs.

There will be some other balance patches in the between as well.\n\n\n\nRevisit from Otherverse Dungeons.* If you didn't know OV dungeons were deleted a while ago along with Chronical gears. And now they will make a come back. In the Festival, they didn't showcase any of it. But in the Chinese Festival, they did release some gameplay. I'm not sure what gear they will give.\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\nMarch 17th, 2022:\u00a0New Level 110 Cap\n\nNew Dungeons* 8 Normal Dungeons and 2 Advanced Dungeons (like Oculus) will be added. Below are some promotion videos.\n+ Saint's War |\u00a0Noblesse Code | Destroyed Castle of the Dead\u00a0| Laboratory of Eternal Flame\n\n* The director stated that leveling \/ base gear farming is too easy and boring, and the gear spectrum is too wide between players (aka newbies vs veterans). Also setting standards on the new and gearless players makes the story boring and meaningless for the rest. So he wants to focus on making the leveling phase part of the content & interesting.\n* Therefore, story dungeons will have\u00a0regular difficulties\u00a0(normal ~ king). Higher difficulty will give more rewards and EXP to level up. Gears will also drop during the story \/ leveling phase. Normal will be doable very easily, but king will require powerful gear such as Ozma's graduate.\n* Hero difficulty\u00a0will make a return as the challenging content for the geared players, including new patterns for mobs. This Hero mode will drop account-bound rewards.\n* Advanced dungeons will haven\u00a0no weekly entry\u00a0limits. Raids weekly entry limit will remains the same. In addition,\u00a0tickets & play point system will be added. This is where you spend FP for the points, use the points to buy the tickets for the advanced dungeons (tradable tickets can also drop). These tickets do not expire on weekly reset. The point is that you don't have to get your weekly homework done on that week. If you're busy, you can still use the tickets the following week.\u00a0Achievements and dungeon missions will be added to motivate playing and make grinding a bit less stressing.\n\n* One of the Advanced dungeon, Noblesse Code, will has a system similar to Squad Mode where you can pick and choose which reward you want to give to which alts.\n* Can be entered with up to 4 characters, solo is fine if you\u2019re strong enough but each char can only get a fixed number of epics so more chars = more pieces. Will have a very high epic drop rate.\n\n\nNew Gears* New gears are added. It's level 110 cap, but gear will be level 105. Gear\u2019s level does not match characters\u2019 max level because they wanted to try something new.\n* He wanted to simplify damage mods. So for DPS, all 6 damage mods (e.g. Smash, Crit Smash, PMI, Str\/Int, All, Bonus) will be merged into \"Damage Increase\" and will be a base option on all gears. For Buffers, all buff options will be merged into a new option called \"Buff Power\" and will be a base option on all gears.\n* He wanted freedom of setups, so the new epic will have no set effects, only single pieces so you can use whatever pieces you want.\n* These new epics will be new other options (e.g. increased CDR rate when enemy is in groggy, etc). Some pieces will have fixed effects, others will have modifiable options. These modifiable options can be changed with mats you get from dungeons.\n* Option growth: New legendaries and epics will have a variety of options that gain EXP and level up.\n\n* Moreover, you can merge duplicates to gain massive gear EXP.\n\n* Ozma pieces and max Black Purgatory rolled Sirocco pieces (including weapons) are also usable for feeding EXP. The required EXP per level will increase exponentially while stat increase per level will decrease, so \u2018maxing out\u2019 won\u2019t be necessary.\n\n* Option transfer: For the pieces with customizable options 1 of the 4 options will be transferable to another piece to replace an option you don\u2019t like. Unsure whether you can just do this for all 4 options at once and finish a piece, but they seem to be implying that you can only do this for 1 option.\n\n* Weapons: There will be 2 different weapons for each kind: 1 focused on damage and 1 focused on skills improvement (similar to Chronicle \/ Talisman shoes). Drop rate for your own weapon will be much higher compared to others.\n* Level 105 Rare\/Unique\/Legendary Equipment:\n+ Rare: Will take over Ghent unique. Fully farmable in 2~3 days.\n+ Unique: 2 different kinds, a damage set similar to 100 legendaries and a set that will be an improved abyssal swap. Will drop very rarely in tradable form.\n+ Legendary: Similar power as the customizable epics but tradable. Designed to be a jackpot tradable gear to feed \/ transfer options to your epics.\n+ Mythic and PoW: Those that are strong in single piece will be usable in place of the same slot 105 pieces for a while. Due to the remaining discrepancies and changes in systems some Mythics will be rebalanced.\n\n* Others:\n+ Inheriting and engraving will stay.\n+ Gear rebalancing can happen more often than before to prevent 'crazy setups'\n+ CDR will cap at 70% for all skills.\n+ In dungeon, gear swapping (e.g. armors, acc and sub) will be restricted.\n+ Dungeon selling: too cheap for too great of a return. Fame will limit dungeon entry (similar to exorcism) but the threshold won\u2019t be too high (still under consideration)\n+ No more hell \/ GoW: farm epics regular dungeons\n\n\n\nMore System Updates* Game\u2019s systems will be drastically changed to reduce reliance on raw damage and improve the ARPG aspect. Will happen across several patches to prevent too many changes happening at once.\n* Warlord and mind stimulant removed\/nerfed (will no longer be necessary in dungeons).\n* Improved TP effect for lower skills (skills below lvl 30): master\/max level readjusted, tp redistribution .\n\n* Readjusted defensive capabilities: Defensive abilities, max HP and armor \/ defense values will be rescaled, mobs will have much less I-frames. Will try to make defensive values and options on gears actually meaningful.\n* Incapacitation gauge: A new gauge will be added below mobs\u2019 HP bar to indicate their status effect immunity. Use appropriate attacks & deal with patterns to deplete the gauge and enter groggy or make the boss vulnerable to status effects.\n\n* Revamped status effects: Status effects like freezing and petrification will be changed, they'll stop the enemies on their track but not actually interrupt their pattern. Other changes are also in plan.\n* 3rd Awakening Skill Change: Too slow, they'll be reduced to about 3 seconds. Still thinking about what to do for a lotta stuff like animated cut-ins etc., plans might change in the future.\n  \n* Renewed Reinforcement \/ Amplification: This is a system unique to 100+ gears. They will have no failure penalty up to +12 reinforcement and +10 amp in exchange for slightly reduced chance and increased cost. Will also have a failsafe system to prevent being stuck at a certain level like +9 too many times.\n* Base Element Boost: Element Boost on passives (such as Soul Bender and Female Nen) will be replaced with skill damage.\n* Creatures: More dynamic participation in dungeons (creature skills) and artifacts renewal. Skills may be modifiable so that they can be more useful in dungeons. Artifacts will have new and meaningful effects. Details still in consideration.\n* Dungeon & Life: A collection of minigames, fun stuff to do outside just running dungeons. Craft\/buy items with what you get here including gears. Use mats that you can get from running dungeons to build new buildings & decorate your village. You can also visit other players\u2019 villages. Won\u2019t be a necessary content for progression.\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n\nMay 2022Meister's Lab* This is where the 7 Meisters make giant robots to fight Bakal.

Trying to come up with a system that's fair for everyone.\n* Abyss swap, rune, talisman: Considered completely removing rune\/talisman and replacing it with a new system but they didn't have the time and too much effort went into it for the players. For now they'll add tradable things to make farming easier.\n* 100 Gear Farming: Doubled mat drops for Ghent, Legs, 22, Oculus.\n* Story changes: Ghent story change, missing prey story, etc. will be added.\n* Buffing powers: Buff values of 3 saders will be rebalanced sometime in the future\n* Character balancing & renewals: Will be continuously performed across the year\n\n\n\nOther Promotion* As always, with winter festival, they usually give out gifts and rewards for viewers. I'll just go over the cosmetics\n* If you pre-order Assault package, you can get exclusive avatar and cute emotes\n\n  \n* They're also releasing new Goth package and viewers can redeem some pieces.\n  \n\n\nReferencesStream Playback  \nKDNF fest 2021 summary  \nYouTube -\u00a0\ud788\uce74\ub9ac\ud0c0\ub9c8  \nGameChosun  \nGameChosun 2  \n\n\n","234":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2609\/Monster-Colosseum-Season-2?page=1  \n\n\n","235":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2611\/Merry-Epic-Christmas?page=1\n\n","236":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2610\/Merry-Christmas-Happy-New-Year?page=1  \n\n\n","237":"\n\n  \n* After Farming Improvement patch was released, everyone has been talking about how difficult it is for new player to progress. So I used some of my alts and ran this dungeon to see what was all the fuss was about.\n\nHow Ghent Changed* Before the patch, your daily reward count was at 20 runs, and each run can early up about 280\u00a0. So literally you could finish all 12 Ghent Unique pieces in like 2 days of farming. On top of that, all the extra Token you got, you can buy heavy weapon from Lindsey for easy money. It was one of the best method to farm gold for new player.\n* After the patch, the daily reward count was changed to 6, and the amount of\u00a0\u00a0you can get per run was severely nerfed.\n\n* So I used 20 of my alts and ran Ghent Palace 120 times full clear on Expert mode with premium contract. I sold everything and also record what Unique dropped. There are 2 things I'm looking for:\n1. How much Token and gold can I get?\n2. If the Unique drop rate is increased, how long can I get all Ghent Unique pieces?\n\nData and Observation\n\n* Token and Gold\n+ From 20 alts, I got 5,411,818 gold. I also got 7,076 Tokens combining both untradable and account-bound versions. Using those will get me about 17 heavy weapons, which can be resold for 509,184 gold, which will earn me 5,921,002\n+ So in average, each time I do my daily 6 runs, I get about 296,050\u00a0.\n+ If you think about it, 6 runs give me about 300k, 20 runs would give about 986,833 gold. When you compare that to my previous analysis, you're not very far off. Granted this is a very small number of runs (120) compared to that data (400), but I'm sure the number won't be too far off.\n+ In conclusion, does Farming patch nerf Ghent as a gold farm place? Not really. However, it's a bit inconvenience that you have to farm it in multiple alts to rack up the Tokens. So for new players, it can be harder to get the gold if they only have 1 character. They can still farm Ghent after the 6 runs, they will just get less gold.\n\n* Character Progression\n+ Since we get much less Token now, our primary source will have to be from dungeon drops. In the 120 runs, I got 48 Uniques and 2 Epics. So yeah, 40% unique drop rate is not bad at all.\n+ Some observation about these Unique drops though. (1) You don't always get the weapon for your class. (2) Not sure if it was intended but the majority of armor drops seem to match the character's mastery. There was only 4 pieces that didn't match (e.g. Heavy Shoulder on Skirmisher).\n\nHow Long to Get 12 Unique Pieces?* It's hard to tell due to RNG. But let say I don't care about armor mastery, and I assumed all the above 20 alts are the same character and from using the above data:\n+ Day 1: I would have Top and Shoulder\n+ Day 2: I would have Ring\n+ Day 3: I would have duplicates\n+ Day 4: I would have Shoes and Magic Stone\n+ Day 5: I would have Bracelet\n+ Day 6: I would have duplicates\n+ Day 7: I would have duplicates again. So I would have given up and used 2,474 Total Token to buy the remaining pieces. If this character happens to be Brawler, I would have the weapon on day 1.\n\n* For new player who only have 1 character, it probably will take about 14 days to complete if you don't take drops into account. But if you count the drops, it will be much faster. But yeah, regardless, it will still be much slower than before the patch.\n\n\n\n","238":"\n\n* This small update adds Guide & Squad mode for Ozma raid along with Hard mode for Sirocco Raid.\n* Full details are located in\u00a0Neople official website.\n* Events\n+ A Melody for Adventurers\n+ Monster Colosseum Season 2\n+ Merry Christmas & Happy New Year\n+ Merry Epic Christmas!\n\n* Sales\n+ Snowman Avatar\n\nComments* A Melody for Adventurers\n+ The extra silver and gold notes are nice.

You also get to choose your talisman and runes.\n+ This mission gives 50\u00a0\u00a0and 15\n\n* The third mission is participate in Heroes' Path: Testament match mode. You don't have to win this part, simply just participate. You can AFK at first room if you want to. Be careful though, if both of you AFK, nobody will get rewards. This mission gives 40\n\n* They also have accumulated reward, simply win Normal channel matches and Testament channel matches to get an extra Title and Aura.

What were dropped? How much gold can you get?\n* Here I clear the dungeon 400 times to see how it's compared to Stormy Route.\n\nProcedure & Data* Roschest is tricky, instead of taking a fixed 8 FP per run like other level 100 dungeon, it takes 1 FP per room. On top of that, the FP required to clear Roschest depends on the mini-boss at room 4. You can follow this\u00a0Black Purgatory Daily Dungeons Simply Explained\u00a0for the optimal route of farming. In a nutshell, it can take anywhere from 9~11 FP to clear the dungeon.\n* Therefore, to be consistent, I decided to do full clear (12 FP). Below is the data for what I got with Neo-Premium without repair cost (each character represents 20 runs at Normal Mode).\n\n* And here's the data from previous Stormy Route runs from my previous post\u00a0Stormy Route: Sirocco \"Nerf\" Debunked. Same procedure, 20 runs, sell all drop, not include repair cost, etc. Jackpot means you encounter the demon dog thingy that drop a bunch of Time's Guide Stones.\n\nDiscussion* In term of raw gold: I used market price 25,999 for\u00a0\u00a0and 5,900 for\n+ Raw gold means what I got by selling all the drops and selling\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the auction hall.\n+ For Stormy Route, you average 1,048,788 gold per 20 runs (aka 6,555 gold per FP)\n+ For Roschest, you average 1,600,821 gold per 20 runs (aka 6,670 gold per FP)\n+ Note that this Roschest average is based on full run of 12 FP, and you earn about 1.75% more gold than Stormy Route, so if you follow the optimal route through the algorithm, I'm sure you can make even more.\n\n* In term of progression:\n+ For Stormy Route, you average 61\u00a0\u00a0per 20 runs (aka 0.38\u00a0\u00a0per FP)\n+ For Roschest, you average 27\u00a0\u00a0per 20 runs (aka 0.11\u00a0\u00a0per FP)\n+ So, if you want more hell mat to run Guide of Wisdom, Stormy Route is probably better place to farm. In return, you only earn just a little bit less gold.\nFinal Impression\n\n* Roschest Outskirts:\n+ Pros:\n- Drops tradable materials like\u00a0 which can easily funneled into another character. You will make more gold than Stormy Route if you sell these in the auction hall.\n- Drops a lot more\u00a0\u00a0than stormy route, which is one of the main complain from lots of players.\n- Drops Black Purgatory materials so you can roll your luck.\n- Drops epic if you're lucky.\n\n+ Cons:\n- Requires a lot more gear to farm effectively. My full Aeterna Berserker can farm Stormy easily. But when I bring him to Roschest, oh man, it wasn't good.\n\n* Stormy Route:\n+ Pros:\n- Drops more hell mats for Guide of Wisdom.\n- Drops a bit more gold, but you will end up making less if you sell all the Aiolites and Time Crystals from Roschest.\n- Doesn't require as much gear to clear.\n\n+ Cons:\n- Those hell mats are untradable, so hard to funnel to another alt.\n- Doesn't drop as much\u00a0, which pretty needed for everything in level 100. With Ozma raid on the horizon, you're gonna need even more.\n- Doesn't drop epic.\n\nWhich One I Farm* Neither, I don't farm 1 dungeon mindlessly with 1 character. I do my daily on multiple alts. Think about it, doing daily 4s on 5 alts is the same as doing 20 runs with 1 alt. Plus I get to enjoying playing variety of characters. So, pick your poison bois.\n\n\n","291":"\n\n* Test server note was released on July 28, 2021.\n* Live server note was released on August 5, 2021.\n* This patch adds damage buffs various QoL to 27 classes.

But since then, many many new contents have been added.\n* This guide is made to help you progress beyond that point. And it's organized bases on the release date of the contents.\n* Before we get started, I'll assume you already read the first addition\u00a0Level 100 Cap: Guide to Gear Progression\u00a0and you already start farming Legendary (5+5) and Epic dungeon (2+2).\n\nTable of Contents* 05\/2020 -\u00a0The Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection\n* 06\/2020 -\u00a0The Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum\n* 08\/2020 -\u00a0Dark Dimension: Signs of a Rift\n* 10\/2020 -\u00a0Sirocco Raid\n* 02\/2021 -\u00a0The Exile Mountains\n* 05\/2021 -\u00a0The Night of Revelation\n* 06\/2021 -\u00a0The Continent of Aeterna\n* 06\/2021 -\u00a0Sirocco Challenge Mode\n* 07\/2021 -\u00a0Black Purgatory\n* 09\/2021 - Grave Tower\n* 10\/2021 - Ozma Raid\n\n\n\nThe Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection* Released on May 2020, this is a 4-man dungeon added just right after level 100 cap was released. You can learn how to clear it from this\u00a0The Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n* The whole point of this dungeon is to get gather enough material (Grim Seeker's Dark Soul) to get your Ditto epic piece. It's named after the Pokemon who can change to any other Pokemon.\n* As the name suggest, upon completing the quest, you can pick any epic piece you want. You can also change it to whatever as well, it would just cost some materials.\n* You can see which piece is the Ditto epic by the star indicator. As you can see, it's a huge help in progressing your character.\n\n* If you don't know which Ditto piece to pick, the Gear Calculator\u00a0has an option to include Ditto. Just pick that and let the program do the job for you. Note that you will need input enough pieces for this option to work.\n  \n\n\nThe Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum* Released in June 2020, this is a harder version of the regular Oculus.\u00a0You can learn how to clear it from this\u00a0The Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n* This content, in my opinion, doesn't really add much to your progression. Because if you're strong enough to do this hard mode, you're pretty much at the end-game already.\n* Most people do this for the epic weapon box\u00a0\u00a0and Product of Wisdom recipes\u00a0.\n+ The\u00a0\u00a0is account-bound so you can farm this on your top geared characters, then use it on your alt since you can choose class specific weapon.\n+ The\u00a0\u00a0can drop at low chance and can be sold for a very expensive price.\n\n\n\nDark Dimension: Signs of a Rift* Released in August 2020, this content has good intention. When upgraded all the way, it can be strong. Unfortunately, the farming time is quite long, and the effort required to get to that point doesn't not worth the trouble.\n* I have done an analysis about this and you can read about it in this\u00a0Dark Dimension: An Analysis of Upgraded Level 100 Legendary Equipment\n\n\nSirocco Raid* Released in October 2020, this is the next big major step in your progression.\n* The main goal of this raid is to get new epic pieces. It also has another Ditto option as well, but here you can only pick in the pull of Sirocco specific pieces.\n\n  \n* This raid adds 5 different sets of 3-pieces along with additional weapon upgrade. Each piece can be fused to your existing epic piece to give you more stat.\n\n  \n* Each set has their own strengths and weaknesses, and the drops are purely RNG. In the Korean server, they already have Sirocco Farming Improvement added. But in the meantime, it has not reached DFOG server.\n* Below is an example of my character having 3 Sirocco Rodos pieces fused to my Bottom, Ring, and Sub Equipment pieces. Unfortunately, I'm still missing the weapon upgrade.\n* The Epic Calculator again also has Sirocco option you can choose to see which one best fit for you.\n\n* You can read about how to do this raid in this\u00a0Sirocco: 7-stages Raid Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\nThe Exile Mountains* Released in February 2021, this is another upgrade to your character. Here instead of upgrading your actual epic pieces, you're upgrading your talisman. You can think of this content as the next version Pandemonium War.\n* The cutline is about Sirocco raid green party. So you don't have to completely grad Sirocco to do this content. This is intended to do side-by-side with Sirocco raid.\n* Here of course you upgrade your current P. War talisman to its Capella's Stigma version. You can also upgrade your runes as well from Rare to Unique tier.\n* Here's an example of my talisman. As you can see, I still need to upgrade my runes.\n* You can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Exile Mountains Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\n\nThe Night of Revelation* Released in May 2021, this is a side solo content of the Exile Mountain.\n* This content is not intended to progress your main character, but rather help you gear up your alts. Think of this as the upgraded version of Pandemonium Meeting.\n* I do this content to buy Prey Raid mat to upgrade level 95 gear to level 100 for my alts. You can also buy budget enchant beads as well. They provide similar stat to Sirocco raid enchants, just a bit weaker.\n* You can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Night of Revelation Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\nThe Continent of\u00a0Aeterna* Released in June 2021, this is another side content that is not intended to progress your main character. You do this content is mainly gear up your synergy characters.\n* In a nutshell, it adds 8 more epics set to level 100 cap that when used in while soloing, it will activate a set of stat. Then when used in a party of 2 or more, it activates another set of stat. This party stats provide huge synergy effects for everyone else but you (you basically a sandbag here).\n* When used appropriately, character that use Aeterna gear can get into end game contents such as Sirocco raid and later contents.\n* The best part about this content is can be easily funneled. So when farmed with enough alts, you can gear up character in no time.\n* You can read everything about this content in this\u00a0Aeterna\u00a0category. It includes guides about how to farm gear, which set to use, how many alts needed to farm, and why you should do this content event for DPS character.\n\n\nSirocco Challenge Mode* Released in June 2021 along with Aeterna, in my opinion, it doesn't really add much progression to your main character. Think of this like the Oculus Hard Mode. If you're strong enough to clear Sirocco Challenge Mode, you're already hit the class ceiling.\n* Really the main rewards from this mode are Chest of Immateriality, new Product of Wisdom, and a show-off aura.\n* Regardless, you can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Sirocco Challenge Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\nBlack Purgatory* Released in July 2021, this is another major upgrade to your character. This content provide 2 type of new materials.\n* Ore of Despair , which is used to change the modifier (via rolling) on the equipment slots that can be fused with Sirocco epic (i.e. Weapon, Bottom, Ring, Sub Equip). Each roll will take 165 Ore and 20k gold.\n\n* Fearsome Eye , which is used to maximize that modifier you rolled with Ore of Despair. Maxing each slot will require 13 eyes.\n\n* For example, I rolled the target option for my weapon of Additional Att. Damage. I can use the 13\u00a0\u00a0to max this modifier to 30% at guarantee success rate.\n\n* These stat that you rolled are independent of your sirocco piece's stat. So you can basically roll for whichever modifier you want that best fit your character's needs.\n* If you don't know which stat to roll for, again, the Epic Calculator also give you the recommended stats to roll for. It basically tries to equalize all the modifiers your sets provide so you can maximize your damage output.\n\n* Of course for this recommendation to work, make sure you select the Black Purgatory options in the calculator.\n\n* You can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Black Purgatory Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\n\nGrave Tower* Released on September 2021, this is another side content that doesn't really add much to your progression. Instead, it's designed to gear up your alts. This tower is extremely hard, so don't expect to get very far.\n* The idea is you send your strongest characters here to gather \"Old Golden Coin\" to buy stuff from the shop. Really the item you want to buy is the epic pot.\n* The great thing about this pot is that you can pick and choose which weapon type you want to buy. For example, if I want Zanbato on my Sword Master, I can just buy the Zanbato pot. Since there's only 2 level 100 epic Zanbato, I at least have 50% chance if getting the weapon I want.\n\n  \n\n\nOzma Raid* Released in October 2021, this raid is another big step to your progression.\n* The concept is similar to Sirocco raid, where you get new epic pieces to fuse to your existing gear. In Sirocco, you fuse with Weapon, Bottom, Ring, and Sub Equipment. In Ozma, you fuse with 5 more slots: Head\/Shoulder, Belt, Shoes, Necklace, Magic Stone.\n* Ozma raid also comes with its Ditto piece, but the major different is the Holy Grail of Faith system, where you can reroll your pieces while filtering out which pieces you don't want.\n* Below are some of great resources for this raid:\n+ Ozma Raid Made Simple\n+ Ozma of Chaos Raid for Dummy\n+ Ozma Raid Tips and Tricks\n+ Ozma Epics Made Simple\n\n  \nChangelog* 11\/21\/2021: Added Grave Tower and Ozma Raid\n\n\n","293":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2362\/Writings-of-the-Apostles?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","294":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Knight classes.

If I can't grad Sirocco in 9 months, how long will Purgatory RNG take?\n* Luckily with the new farming improvement released in Korea server, you can possibly grad in about 3 months ... if you're whale enough.\n\nTable of contents* What is Purgatory Grad\n* For the Casual\n* For the Whales\n* For the GO ALL OUT\n* TLDR\n\n\n\nWhat is Purgatory Grad* In a nutshell, Black Purgatory provides 2 new materials:\n+ Ore of Despair\u00a0, which is used to change the modifier (via rolling) on the equipment slots that can be fused with Sirocco epic (i.e. Weapon, Bottom, Ring, Sub Equip). Each roll will take 165 Ore and 20k gold.\n+ Fearsome Eye\u00a0, which is used to maximize that modifier you rolled with Ore of Despair. Maxing each slot will require 13 eyes.\n\n+ For example, I rolled the target option for my weapon of Additional Att. Damage. I can use the 13\u00a0\u00a0to max this modifier to 30% at guarantee success rate.\n\n* Regardless of how many\u00a0\u00a0you have in your inventory, since you have 4 slots to RNG roll, you will need at least 52\u00a0\u00a0to max their stats.\n* So what does it take to get 52 Fearsome Eyes? Let's do some simple math.\n\n\n\nFor the Casual* Let's say you're the most casual player in the game. You don't farm any daily dungeons at all. The only thing you did is to do 2 Black Purgatory level 1 runs.\n* Let's also say you're has the worst RNG in the game, you will get 550\u00a0\u00a0per week (275x2) with no gold\u00a0\u00a0flips.\n+ Lucky for you, in the recent KDnF update, you can buy up to 2 Fearsome Eye boxes\u00a0\u00a0per week for a price of 630\u00a0\u00a0each.\n+ So with your casual earning of 550\u00a0, each week you can get 0.87\u00a0. Therefore, to graduate Black Purgatory as an extreme casual with worst RNG, it will take you about 60 weeks (aka 15 months).\n+ I'm still collecting data from daily dungeon runs. But so far, each daily normal runs of 4 dungeons gives you about extra 52\u00a0. So add that to your 550\u00a0\u00a0will get you about 1.45\u00a0\u00a0per week, which will translate to about 36 weeks (9 months) to grad.\n\n* Let's say you have the best RNG, you get 292\u00a0\u00a0and 1\u00a0\u00a0every level 1 run.\n+ 584\u00a0\u00a0will get you about 0.93\u00a0\u00a0per week from\u00a0, adding 2\u00a0\u00a0from your runs will translate to about 18 weeks (4.5 months).\n+ If you add the daily farming, that will bring down to about 15 weeks (3.75 months).\n\n* AND that doesn't take in account for the\u00a0\u00a0needed to roll for the modifier you want. I doubt many people can get it in 1 roll.\n\n\n\nFor the Whales* When the KDnF update hit live server, each box of 50\u00a0\u00a0was sold in the auction hall for about 1.2 million gold (sauce).\n\n* So really, you don't even have to run the content and just buy those boxes for your weekly 2\u00a0. Therefore, to get 52\u00a0, it will take you 26 weeks (6.5 months) of buying these boxes.\n* AND to buy 52\u00a0\u00a0(aka 32,760\u00a0), you will need to spend 786 million gold.\n* AND\u00a0(of course) that doesn't take in account for the\u00a0\u00a0needed to roll for the modifier you want.\n\n  \n\n\nFor the GO ALL OUT* What if you buy the\u00a0\u00a0and has the best RNG? what then...\n* Well, in this case I will assume you do level 4, because whale...\n* Both level 4 runs give 936\u00a0\u00a0and 2\u00a0. So you only need to spend 7.7 million gold to buy the remaining 324\u00a0\u00a0for the weekly\u00a0.\n* At this rate, you can grad in 13 weeks (3.25 months) and only need to spend about 25 million gold.\n* AND\u00a0(of course) that doesn't take in account for the\u00a0\u00a0needed to roll for the modifier you want.\n\n\n\nTL;DR* Casuals:\n+ Worst RNG + level 1 BP = 15 months\n+ Worst RNG + level 1\u00a0BP + Daily = 9 months\n+ Best RNG + level 1\u00a0BP = 4.5 months\n+ Best RNG + level 1\u00a0BP + Daily = 3.75 months\n\n* Whales:\n+ No BP + Gold only = 6.5 months &\u00a0786 million gold\n+ Best RNG + level 4 BP + Gold = 3.25 months & 25 million gold\n\n\n","298":"\n\n* On July 7, 2021 Japan server has released Knight 3rd Awakening\n* They also released the Summer package along with other events\n* Updates\n\n+ This update adds Knight 3A.\n+ Detail information are located in JDnF official website.\n\n* Sale\n+ Their Summer Package: Pretty much the same look we have in global server.

Here they follow the normal pattern like every other dungeon in DFO (i.e. 1 FP per room).\n* Below is the map of all 4 dungeons. As you can see, it will take 8 FP to rush to boss. Then they all have 4 extra rooms (highlighted in white).\n* The way these dungeons are designed is that there are specific mini-bosses and named champion in specific rooms.\n\nWhich Spawn Where* Beside the final boss, there are 3 other type that can spawn.\n* The Mini-boss: These ALWAYS spawns in the first intersection (room 4) of every map. They usually drop an Aiolite or Time Crystal.\n+ For Outskirts map, they are 3 possible spawns, and we will talk about it in a bit.\n+ For the other 3 maps, these mini-bosses are the Followers of the Dark Knights.\n\n* The Intruder: From what I've seen, these spawns about 2 rooms before the boss.\n+ If you have played the real Black Purgatory dungeon, these are the boss guarding the crossroad (Jade, Onyx, Venta).\n+ Killing these will drop a handful (~10)\u00a0\u00a0and possibly\u00a0.\n* The Fresh Blood (aka Chanpion monsters): These are the one that have the green name above them.\n+ They only spawn in the \"extra\" rooms randomly (aka the one highlighted in white).\n+ They drop handful of Aiolites and Time Crystals (really anywhere from 1~10 if not more). These will be your main source of income while farming.\n  \nHow to Farm Effectively* I'll run some number in future post to compare between them and stormy.\n* Anyway, beside doing your normal daily clears for the special gold card flips, Outskirts of Roschest will be the best place for you to farm on, for a few reasons:\n+ The bosses there are a lot easier to kill, their patterns are not as pain in the ass.\n+ It's the only dungeon where you can predict the location the mini-boss, intruder, and the fresh blood, therefore you can spent FP more efficiently.\n\n* When you're at the first intersection (room 4), the boss you fighter there will determine the possible location of other Fresh Blood and whether you will have an Intruder.\n+ In the explanation below, the marked rooms are possible locations of Fresh Blood mob. The Red Mark is the direct indicator of Intruder present.\n\n  \n* If Onyx Black: Proceed downward!\n+ If you see a Fresh Blood in the Red Mark\u00a0room, that mean you're guarantee to have an Intruder. So kill the Fresh Blood for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0.\u00a0Then go back and rush to boss, killing the Intruder on the way and get your extra\u00a0.\n+ If you DON'T see a Fresh Blood in the\u00a0Red Mark\u00a0room, that mean you won't have an Intruder (bummer). The next location of Fresh Blood will be one room over (Green Mark). So go there for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0,\u00a0then\u00a0go back and rush to boss.\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n* If Venta: Proceed straight! forward the Orange Mark.\n+ That's the only place you will find Fresh Blood. There's no indicator of whether you get Intruder. So clear for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0\u00a0and rush to boss.\n\n* .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\nIf Jade: Proceed straight! to Green Mark instead of going down to Red Mark. Why?\n+ If you go to Red Mark first and you don't see a a Fresh Blood (wasted 1 FP), you will need go to next room Green Mark. Whereas if you find a Fresh Blood right at Green Mark, you can just back track and rush to boss.\n+ So when you get to the Green Mark and nothing there, go to Red Mark, kill the Fresh Blood for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0.\u00a0Then go back and rush to boss, killing the Intruder on the way and get your extra\u00a0.\n\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \nReferenceshttp:\/\/df.nexon.com\/df\/cast\/article\/MDU1NTMhttps:\/\/blog.naver.com\/win4778\/222243060566\n\n","300":"\n\n* In order to keep this article short and sweet, I will assume you already know what Arad Pass works and what the general rewards are.\n* In case you still don't know what this is, DFOG already has a version of it here Arad Pass Season 1.

To celebrate this class, new Arad Pass was added exclusively just for her. Here I summarize what are in this package.\n\n* This pass is very similar to the Arad Pass we already know. You pick your Blade as the character, then you do daily, weekly, seasonally mission to level up your pass level and get rewards.\n\nBlade Exclusive Benefit* So why would you want to buy this pass and not the regular Arad Pass? From what I see, this gives you exclusive Blade avatar with a hood just like her concept art AND a pet that's her dog. There you go, the whole concept art collection.\n* Below is what the avatar look like, I dig it. Now only if it also comes in different color.\n\n* And here's her pet and its skills\n\n* The pet's stat is pretty good. Gives you +1 level of 2A passive and +18% critical damage.\n\n  \nRewards By Levels* The rewards are pretty good. You can see these rewards in details in this\u00a0supplementary\u00a0page (they are quick google translate and pretty self explanatory)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nReferenceshttp:\/\/df.nexon.com\/df\/pg\/bladepass2021  \n\n\n","308":"\n\n* With the release of summer package 2021, we now have a new title that everyone has been talking about.\n* Here I'll explain why it's unique and why it's extremely popular, even in Korea.\n\nHow It Work* When you get the package, opening the title box will give you 1 of 45 different titles.\n\n* The pool is 45 title because you get a chance of getting 2 type of titles, Normal and Platinum (5 of each kind).\n* Of the Platinum title, it's further split into 8 titles (each giving damage to a particular skill ranging from level 30 to level 80). So 8 times 5 is 40, plus 5 normal title, give 45 titles.\n\nWhy It Special* 15% damage modifier is nothing special for DFO global, but it's the additional damage to skill level is what make it unique. This is the first time we have had this in global version.\n* This type of title is nothing new in Korea. They have had this for multiple packages, and it's one of the most popular title there. If you look at player ranking in\u00a0Dunfaoff, pretty everyone there has this title.\n* So why is it so popular? well, the current meta is more doing sustain damage with Black Purgatory and Ozma raid. So many players are switching to those type of build, which include more Cool Down Reduction (CDR) gears. Adding to the list is talisman, which many of them further increase damage for those skills.\n* There you can see, Talisman + CDR gear such as Crossroad set + This title = OP gear.\n\nHow to Get It* If you look at the stat for all title, the best one is \"A Midsummer Night Dream\" due to the 15% modifier. You can RNG reroll this title for the one you want with \"Title Change Ticket\" for 500,000 gold each.\n* Another way to guarantee getting the title with the skill damage you want is through the coin shop.\n* For 4 coins, you can upgrade any title into \"A Midsummer Night's Dream title\". Then for another 4 coins, you can upgrade that title into the Platinum version that has a random skill option.\n* Then you can RNG reroll this Platinum title for the skill you want for 2 coin each.\n\n* Really if you think about it, it will take at least 10 coins to get the Platinum you want, and you may need to reroll more for the skill. So Neople put another option in this coin shop.\n* For 10 coins, you can buy the \"A Midsummer Day Title Box\", which basically A Midsummer Night's Dream Platinum version (aka best version title) AND you get to select which skill you want on that too.\n\nWhich Skill to Pick* One of our player with explorer club \"Dream\" has kindly compiled a comprehensive popularity list for every class in the game using\u00a0Dunfaoff\u00a0ranking system (basically going into people profile and see which level title they use).\n* You can see that list in this\u00a0BiS Skill Boosting Title For Each Class\u00a0Excel Sheet. Of course, only use this as reference and don't follow it blindly.\nShould I Buy This Title* Our official DFOG Content Creator, Yong\\*, has created a great flow chart just to answer this question. It also compares this title with previous ones we had.\n* In a nutshell, this title is pretty much for min-maxing your character. Below is an example from KDnF player showing the damage increase.\n* In the picture below, both titles give the same 15% modifier, but the one on the left give 10% damage to level 45 skill. This player is a Female Ranger, which level 45 skill\u00a0(Death Hawk) is extremely popular. This player concluded that the damage increase was only about 2.5%.\n\nReferenceshttps:\/\/m.blog.naver.com\/tjehdrms0908\/222038684051Reddit -\u00a0Yong\\*'s \"Should I Buy This Title\" Flow Chart  \n\u00a0Excel -\u00a0BiS skill boosting title for each class  \n\n\n","309":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2301\/Bullets-Defender-of-the-Skies?page=1  \n\n\n","310":"\n\n* We all know that Aeterna is all about synergy gear. We all hear people say \"Aeterna is only good for synergy character\". But did you know these epics are actually really good for soloing play?\n* Here I'll quickly show you how strong these epics are and why you should do this content. Playing as a NOOB berzerker.\n\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }  \nWhat Gear?* Really this character is super barebone. I ran Bee set on him, and in case you don't know, all Aeterna sets when solo will have the same stat.\n* I got nothing on him. No enchants, aura, avatar, talisman, pet, insignia. No gear retexture. NOT even swap set. NOTHING.\n* The only thing I got is +6 refinement on the weapon.\n\n* With this gear, I was able to clear Black Shrine in about 1m15s with 48% Crit Chance.\n\nShould You Do Aeterna?* 1,000% yes, even if you're playing a DPS character. This content provide a much much much faster progression to your character with very little investment.\n* If you're one of those alterholic player, this is great to gear up your dead alts. Farming with enough alts can get you full 11\/11 Aeterna epic in a week.\n* Take that in contrast with trying to clear 2+2 with full legendary gear. Full legendary will take you anywhere from 2.5~3 weeks of daily 5+5.

It was quickly abused and patched up with an Emergency Maintenance.\n* This article explain the situation and hopefully it can be avoided in future events.\n\nWhat is the Event* You can read the full event page here. But in the nutshell, this is a leveling event where you can pick any character and potentially level it up to max 100 in a very short amount of time.\n* This type of event uses a special type of dungeon, where you can fly through everything and level up very quickly.\n\n* The one item that was being abused was the weapon. When your event character hit level 95, they give you a selective level 100 epic weapon that has +12 reinforcement \/ +8 refined.\n\nHow It Was Abused* Before the Emergency Patch, the weapon from this box can actually be transferred to another character using NPC Magar Rosenbach, and you can select event character over and over.\n* So what happened was players was using this weapon to attempt +13 reinforcement. If it success, they would transfer it to their main. If fail, they would delete that event character and choose another character in the account as event character. The process is then repeat over and over.\n\n  \nRespond from Neople* The problem was quickly brought up to the developer and it was quickly patch\n  \n* Personally, from my point of view, this was definitely not a bug, but rather just an oversight. It was possibly a simple human error. Regardless, I thought they did a great job at addressing the problem in such a short amount of time.\n\n\n","312":"\n\n+ This update adds 3rd awakening for all Female Gunner classes.

Looks like they kind of speed up the pathing process because in Korea, BP modes are added about 2 weeks after Lancer 3A.\n* They also added the Adventure Reputation, which was added in Korea with the\u00a0Ozma Raid\u00a0release back in May.\n\n* Sirocco Farming QoL has also been added. More detail on this QoL from the KDnF Patch here.\n\n* They also adds Aeterna option for sader classes as well.\nEvents* Lancer 3A, generic event, but they also give a box that give a random lancer weapon.

It give you skill cut-in, party frame, and slime twin creature box.\n\n  \n  \n* Amazing box, nothing special really\n+ gives you 1,500 Time's Guide Stone and a 156 FP pot.\n+ gives you decent beads.\n- Sub Equip: All stat + 80\n- Sub Equip: PMI + 70\n- Magic Stone: All stat +60\n- Magic Stone: All Ele + 20\n- Earring: All stat +125\n\n* Guide \/ Squad Supporters, basically give you more reward when you do guide and squad mode.\n\n* Mileage Shop, interestingly they add new emotes for 500 mileage.\n\n  \nReferenceshttps:\/\/arad.nexon.co.jp\/news\/update\\_view.aspx?no=12281\n\n","316":"\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting Area\ndnfaos\\_town.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nHero's Warfront\ndnfaos\\_ready.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nCombat\ndnfaos\\_battle.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n","317":"\n\n* This week updates doesn't add new content really. But instead, it adds UI improvement for the chatting system. Here are the highlights.\n* Problem:\u00a0The current chat window is not freely adjustable in placement and size.\n+ Solution:\u00a0You can adjust the size of the chat window, insane size.\n\n+ The chat window can be moved separately from the megaphone window.\n\n+ The default size of the megaphone window is changed from 4 lines to 3 lines.\n\n* Problem:\u00a0The conversation filter in the chat window was inconvenient to operate and the setting state was not saved properly.\n+ Solution: The ability to turn off filters in the System tab at once is added. You don't have to click each one individually.\n\n+ When you're using external chat, you can now hide the \"system\" chat.\n\n* Problem:\u00a0Dungeon & Fighter does not have many ways to communicate between adventurers in the game.\n+ Solution: Channel chat added.\u00a0You can talk to people on the same channel. I guess now you don't have to be in the same map area to see other people chat.\n+ If you chat more than 10 times in a row at intervals of 3 seconds or less, you cannot use the chat for 30 seconds. I suppose this is a way to reduce spam.\n+ You can use the channel chat directly through the shortcut key (\/c).\n+ New\/returning users are displayed in green, and cannot set a separate color change.\n\n* Problem:\u00a0Due to the nature of the game, where character changes are frequent, guild conversations are often cut off in the middle, making it difficult to communicate with guild members.\n+ Solution:\u00a0You can view the last 20 guild conversations when you log in.\n\n* BONUS: The new \"fade\" option is added for megaphone chat and regular chat.\n+ Since you can freely move them around, you can actually overlap the megaphone\u00a0chat onto your regular chat, then set the echo chat to \"fade\".\n+ In the example below, this player resize megaphone\u00a0to the smallest possible, then overlap, then fade. Now you will never have to see megaphone\u00a0ever again.

Be sure to check back on this guide for any edit made in the future.\n\nTable of Contents* Basic Concepts\n* Some Housekeeping Stuffs\n* Building Related Information\n+ Seria's Tree\n+ Remedial Basilica\n+ Bakery\n+ Adventurer's Guild Office\n+ Linus' Forge\n+ Sharan's Wizard Guild\n+ Loton's Alchemy Shop\n+ Danjin's Jar Shop\n\n* Adventurer Related Information\n+ Which Attribute to Invest\n+ What about Critical?\n\n* Tips and Tricks\n* References\n\n\nBasic Concepts* In the beginning, you start with Seria's Tree. This is basically your main command center. The higher level you upgrade, the more buildings are unlocked. Note that you will start out with only a portion of the map as buildable, you will have to upgrade Seria's Tree to uncover more building spaces.\n* You will start with 4 Adventures, and you can send them to various missions so you can earn rewards and upgrade your building. The more building you have, the more adventures you can recruit.\n\n\n\nSome Housekeeping Stuffs* The game shuts down when you move channel: Unlike Arad Adventure, you will need to open the game up and start it every time you move channel. The good news is that the game will still run when you switch characters.\n* When you remove a building, you DON'T get a refund: This is crucially important because gold is tight in the early game. Most people will just build like the picture below.\n\n* When placing a building, only when the road is connected, guests can visit:\n+ There are 11 building, and this only apply to the ones that sell stuff (e.g. Bakery, Dress Room, Market). So pay attention to the description.\n+ You can build additional path to make sure guest can come in.\n\n* Roads provided by default cannot be removed: The highlighted stone paths are provide by default, so use them to place your building.\n\n\n\nBuilding Related Information* Most of your building can be found in the construction tab. Higher level building will require Soul as well (I'll show you how to get them later).\n\n\n\nSeria's Tree* Just like when you run dungeon, your adventures inside this mini-world also consume FP while they're on exhibitions.\u00a0 Adventures will consume 1 FP for each monster they defeat. Consume 4 FP if they die.\n* The higher level Seria's Tree is, the faster your adventures can recover FP.\n+ Level 1: Recovers 1 fatigue every 50 seconds (total recovery = 2 hours and 10 minutes)\n+ Level 5: Recover 1 fatigue every 46 seconds (total recovery = 2 hours)\n+ Level 10: Recovery 1 fatigue every 41 seconds (total recovery = 1 hour 47 minutes)\n+ Level 15: Recovery 1 fatigue every 36 seconds (total recovery = 1 hour 34 minutes)\n\n\n\nRemedial Basilica* When an Adventure dies, they go here. Higher level will revive them faster.\n+ Level 1: 90 seconds to full recovery\n+ Level 15: 20 seconds to full recovery\n\n\n\nBakery* This is a place where you craft stuffs to sell to customer that walked in for coins. The basic one is bread.\n\n\n\nAdventurer's Guild Office* This is the most important building for mid-late game. This is your ONLY source of SOUL.\n* Think of this like a place where you send out hit-list for your adventures. You can send out up to 4 adventures to hunt down those hit-list. As you can see, the higher level these hit-list are, the more gold and higher tier souls you can get.\n\n\n\nLinus' Forge* This is where you can make weapon and other equipment to make your adventures stronger. Higher equipment will require higher tier souls.\n\n\n\nSharan's Wizard Guild* Just like \"Linus' Forge\" where you get your weapon and armor, in Sharan place, you can craft your accessory.\n\n\n\nLoton's Alchemy Shop* You can craft potion here to help your Adventures survive longer. They will be consume automatically.\n\n\nDanjin's Jar Shop* Of course, what is a mini-game that doesn't have RNG gacha machine? Here you basically break pots for a chance of strong equipment.\n\n\nAdventurer Related Information* You start out with 4 adventures and you get more as you place more building. Each adventure will have 4 equipment slots, and you unlock them as you level up.\n* Just like all the old school MMORPG, each level up you get attribute point to put them into 4 possible places: Attack, Defense, Health, and Crit. You can reset attribute as well, it would just cost a bunch of coins.\n\n\n\nWhich Attribute to Invest* Below is the comparison between Attack (Blue), Defense (Red), and Health (Gray), compiled by the KDnF community. The x-axis is the number of point invested for each stat. The y-axis is the amount of hit needed to kill a mob or the amount of hit needed to kill the adventure. (See EDIT at the bottom for further recommendation)\n\n* As you can see, whichever curve is the\u00a0stiffest is the one you should invest in. I'll give you some examples.\n* Example 1:\u00a0If you invest 12 points in defense based on adventurer level 21, you need to hit 22 times to kill the adventurer, and you need 2 points to increase one.\n\n* Example 2:\u00a0At level 31 adventurer, if you invest 11 points in attack power, you need to hit 8 times to kill a mob, and 3 points are required to reduce 1. As you can see, investing on attack power is not as efficient as Defense.\n\n* Example 3:\u00a0If you invest 16 points of HP based on Adventurer level 41, you need to hit 24 times to kill the Adventurer, and you need 3 points to add 1 more. Again, still not as efficient as Defense.\n\n* So here're the TLDR:\n+ Attack Power: Efficiency is high in the beginning, but decreases with investment.\n+ Defense: Low efficiency at the beginning, but increases with investment.\n+ Health: Shows a certain efficiency, but falls short compared to defense.\n\n\n\nWhat about Critical?* KDnF has a chart for that too. Here are the comparison between Attack (Blue) vs. Critical (Orange). The x-axis is the number of point invested for each stat. The y-axis is the calculated attack power. Here they assume that 1% attack is the same as 1% critical.\n* As you can see, there's a huge gap between the two. Unless you can equip that much attack power from epic tier items, it doesn't worth putting point on Critical.\n\n\n\nTips and Tricks* Building:\n+ Those building that sell items (e.g. bakery), the entrance of the building must face the path so customers can come in and buy things.\n+ The blacksmith & guild office doesn't sell anything, so they don't have to face the path.\n+ It is recommended to upgrade the building in the order of Tree \u2192 Guild Office \u2192\u00a0Blacksmith. (Higher level Tree = higher fatigue recovery speed up per hour, Higher level Guild Office = more Soul farming required for building upgrade, Higher Blacksmith = Making higher items necessary for hunting)\n\n* Making Coin:\n+ In the beginning, they give you a free bakery, so you just have to send the characters to the goblin hunting grounds, farm the ingredients, and make and sell bread. (25 coins each)\n+ There're also Market and Dress Room as well, so use those to make coin the same way as bread. (Market 40 coins each, Dressing room 60 coins each)\n\n* Mob Stat:\n+ Goblin: HP 420, Attack 80, Defense 50\n+ Tau: HP 2600, Attack 140, Defense 50\n+ Bigfoot: HP 3700, Attack 184, Defense 50\n+ Walker: HP 5200, Attack 238, Defense 50\n+ Kashipa: HP 6500, Attack 323, Defense 50\n+ Auca: HP 7700, Attack 373, Defense 50\n\nEDIT 9\/3\/2021* Another strategy that claimed to work well is the \"Glass Canon\". It basically says that end game subjugation like Isys and above have so much damage that it's better just dump all your point into Attack. As long as your adventure can do 1 hit, that's all that worth it. The reddit threads are:\n+ [Arcade Fighter Online] Sirocco Cleared\n+ Week 2 of AFO...Belfast is oof.\n\n* I was interested and reset 4 of my adventures who were level 83, 71, 70, and 69, who were struggling to clear Luke subjugation. It costed be about 150k coins or so and I changed them all to attack. Their gears and stat as follow. Blow in the hole, it seemed to work quite well.\n* If you're a player who do all Defense like me right at the beginning, I don't think you wasted your time and coin. I thought the leveling process with Defense went well. It's only the Subjugation part that didn't pay off.\n\nEDIT 9\/17\/21* I was finally able to defeat Sirocco in subjugation. Below is the proof and my characters stats along with my main building levels.\n\n* What make Sirocco hard is that she does AoE damage and she heals 1,000 HP every few second. What I did to defeat her is basically keep sending adventures over and over. I swapped all my adventures from Defense to Attack.\n* As you can see, after defeating Sirocco, 8 adventures were out of FP, and 8 adventures were at about half FP. So make sure you have enough adventures that are at high enough level before you face Sirocco.\n\n\nReferences[\ud301] \ube44\ud2b8 \uc564 \ud30c\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4\ubaa8\uc74c  \n[\ud301] Bit & Fighter \ud301 \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4! \uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788 \uc368\ubd24\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4  \n\ub358\ud30c] \ube44\ud2b8\uc564\ud30c\uc774\ud130 \uac74\ubb3c \ubcc0\uc2e0(\ucf54\uc2a4\ud2ac) \/ \uc2dc\ub85c\ucf54 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4  \n[\uc815\ubcf4] \uc0e4\ub780\uc758 \ub9c8\ubc95\uc0ac \uae38\ub4dc 10\ub819\uc815\ubcf4  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rgmwur3CVgY  \n\n\n","319":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2411\/Epic-Rental-Service?page=1\n\n","320":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2410\/Spears-of-Piercing-Destiny?page=1\n\n","321":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Lancer classes.

The best way to know your critical rate is to go to Training Center in Hendon Myre. Once in, just cast your buff still and see what the crit rate is.\n* For example: While in town, my crit rate is 76.6%. In training center, my crit rate is 96.6%. With my buff skill, it's 100.6%, which is plenty.\n* Refer to\u00a0this spreadsheet\u00a0to see where your class stands (credit to\u00a0u\/freecomkcf)\n\nWays to Hit Critical Cap* There are 4 equipment slots that can give you Critical Chance through enchantment: Head\/Shoulder, Beat, Shoes, and Sub Equipment. With proper Enchants, you can get up to 22% Critical Chance increase.\n\n* With new players, for Head\/Shoulder, Beat, Shoes I used Noblesky Green Bijou Bead\u00a0, which gives 5% magical crit chance for each slot (aka. +15%). For Sub Equipment, I used Noblesky Blue Bijou Bead\u00a0, which gives me 2% magical crit chance. So in total, I got 17% through enchants.\n* Avatars and Emblems are another great source of Crit Chance. Here you can get Crit from Red and Green Emblems. Below are my example:\n+ For Red Emblem slots, I used multi-colored Rare Red-Green (Int + Magic Cri)\u00a0. Each one gave me 1.1% crit. Therefore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are 4.4% Crit.\n+ For Green Emblem slots, I used Rare Green (Magic Cri)\u00a0. Each one gave me 2.2%. Therefore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are 8.8%. I used those rare green for the aura\u00a0\u00a0too, so that's another extra 4.4% for a total of 13.2%\n+ On top of that, the Aura itself\u00a0\u00a0gave me an extra 10%.\n\n* Other source you can look out for are Pet and Tittle. For my example, the Pet\u00a0\u00a0gave me 5%, and the Title\u00a0\u00a0gave me 3%.\n\nOther Damage Increase Tips* Use appropriate Enchants on other equipment slots. This part depends on the class you're playing. DFO classes can be divided into 4 damage categories:\n+ Fixed Physical - so look for Independent Att and\/or Strength cards\/beads\n+ Fixed Magical - so look for Independent Att and\/or Int cards\/beads\n+ Percent Physical - so look for Physical Weapon Att cards\/beads\n+ Percent Magical - so look for Magical Weapon Att cards\/beads\n\n* Really the easiest way to know which one is your class is though the\u00a0DFO class roles Excel Sheet. Here's an example of what I used for my Male Mechanic.\u00a0NOTE: Always use Elemental Damage when you can, those trump other damage type.\n+ Grim Seeker Fighter\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Weapon Magical Attack)\n+ Officer Mercel\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Elemental Damage)\n+ Hound Cyrus\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0(Elemental Damage)\n+ Anje Wane for\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0(All Stat)\n+ Heat Researcher Zadracon\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0(Elemental Damge)\n\n* For your convenience, I have indexed the recommended enchants for each equipment slots.\n* Reinforcement\/Refinement on weapon is another huge damage boost.\n+ For Percent Class, Reinforce the weapon (+10 should be enough)\n+ For Fixed Class, Refine the weapon (+6\/+7 should be enough)\n\n* Insignia\u00a0is another easy way.\n+ Fixed Physical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Punishment\n+ Fixed Magical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Spirit\n+ Percent Physical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Protection\n+ Percent Magical, use\u00a0\u00a0Perfect Insignia of Blessing\n\n* Gems\u00a0to go along with your insignia\n+ One\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(element type of your choice)\n+ One\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(physical\/magical crit)\n+ The other 2 slots can be whatever, usually hit rate and attack speed\n\n* Where can I get them?\u00a0The easiest way is to joint a guild, then you only need to log in weekly to get Guild Coin\u00a0. Then walk to the Guild Hideout, talk to the NPC to buy your goods.\n\n* Swap Set is also huge, NEVER forget about them. You can get your set from Operation: Hope dungeon. You can read more in this\u00a0Swap Set: The Essential Tool for Damage\u00a0post.\n* Cube contract is absolutely a must. You need to make your weapon inflict an element to DO elemental damage and Level 100 legendary\/unique weapon can't do that. Therefore you will need\u00a0, which can be bought with gold in Cera shop (500,000\u00a0\u00a0for 7 days).\n+ Once you get the contract, you can select the type of element inflict you want by clicking on the cube in your \"Material\" tab in your inventory. When you see a color cube at the bottom, you're good to go.\n\n* Automated Player Characters (APCs) is one of the last resort if you really need to. These are synergy classes that can give you damage boost. They're very cheap and can be\u00a0bought from auction hall. The common ones are Number 28\u00a0\u00a0and Soldoros\u00a0.\n\n  \nChangelog* 10\/1\/2021: Reworked this page to include more explanations than just bullet points.\n\n\n","400":"\n\n\n\n\nDungeon\ngrakkarak.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

I think the genre of action games is different from the hack and slash genre.\n+ If hack and slash is a pleasant way to sweep away monsters, action game is suppose to use the right skills at the right time, focusing on the battle with the monsters, and to lead the battle advantageously by avoiding or destroying the pattern in an appropriate way when a dangerous situation comes.\n+ In recent years, Dungeon & Fighter has been continuously maintained without any major changes or challenges in terms of system or gameplay. As a result, I felt like the fun in the game was diminishing little by little.\n+ If we focus only on creating content in the same way as before, we could have released more content at a faster time, but it is too old to keep piling up the same things, so repeating the same actions no longer makes sense. Before, I thought I had to try new things.\n+ Since we thought that it was impossible to simply add one or two systems or dungeons to try these changes, we integrated and added related systems while expanding the max level.\n+ Of course, some people will find it difficult to make a sudden change, and some would like to start with a small change. We ourselves had a lot of such concerns and worries. And even now, I still have a lot of fear of change, but nevertheless, I decided that it would be more efficient to carry out overall innovation in line with the opportunity for max level expansion than to proceed while modifying the past one by one. I thought it would be more comfortable for adventurers to adapt.\n\n* Of course, forcing too big a change on you is also not a desirable direction, so we tried to make it possible for those who want to play similar to the previous one to enjoy DnF without major changes.\n+ For example, elements that are helpful for dungeon capture, such as the neutralization gauge and enhanced backstep skill, have been added, but don't worry too much about those elements, and you will not have any problems dealing with monsters in the same way as before.\n\n* To recap, I can say that there are two things that I thought most important this time. The first is the action, the second is the equipment.\n+ The biggest direction of the action is that it is about to start a change from the existing hack and slash genre of killing monsters with powerful skills to a direction that strengthens the action, which places importance on fighting with monsters.\n+ Accordingly, it was thought that the character could be adjusted accordingly by reducing the monster's harshness first, and the monster's attack power that ignores the character's defense was deleted. After deleting all of them, those patterns were changed to be used only partially in essential situations.\n+ Second, to talk about the equipment, the existing equipment up to level 100 had their own characteristics but basically the equipment has a lot of similar options. I thought that the playstyle that was too uniform without any character distinction.\n+ Although the damage is a bit lacking, there are equipment that you can play without thinking much, while there are settings that can create more powerful damage even if you embrace some penalties. we hope that adventurers will be able to enjoy the game in a way that they find enjoyable.\n+ And since all of these equipment shouldn't be swayed too much by RNG, we've increased the drop rate of epic gear significantly more than before.\n\n* So, in the 105 gear situation, I think it will be a time when balance becomes more important than ever, and I will continue to do my best to update balance. The direction of action and equipment mentioned above is expected to create a very big change that encompasses the game as a whole.\n+ We made efforts to lower the play hurdles by strengthening the in-game guide, but nevertheless, as I said at the last festival, in the case of this max level expansion, we are prepared to have more modifications.\n+ If there is still an excessively i-frame or unreasonable pattern, or if you have equipment with a strange balance, there is a high probability that we missed it because there are too many things to worry about. If you do, we will always keep our eyes and ears open, so please let us know. We will continue to do our best to improve the game.\n\n* After a long period of preparation for the update, it is finally available to adventurers, but I can't guarantee that this update will be a success. The evaluation is not made by us, but by the players. However, after time has passed, this level cap was a necessary update to walk on the right path to make Dungeon & Fighter more interesting in the future.\n\nReferencesDirector's Note  \n\n\n","430":"\n\n* DFO ExStream is a traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (Mar. 22nd).\n\nContent* Part 2 of\u00a0DFOG 7th Anniversary. No new content, just more events to get Vandrassil's Leaf.\n* Still no news of Assault\n\nEvents* Elven Tales Change: Entry limit changed to 5 times per day. Chance of getting reward stays same.\n* Elven Rush\n+ Maze runner event where you try to clear the dungeon as soon as possible within the time limit. There's no indicator, no mini-map. So you will have to try your best.\n+ Higher level dungeons will have more obstacles.\n\n* Elven Ring\n+ Clear optimal dungeon to get Elven Jewel Pouch. You can get 7 type of jewels from this.\n+ Then combine jewels to get various effects. This one, for example, increases the changes of Prion\/Sponger Intrusion in Watcher in the Rift.\n\nSales* Classic Rare Avatar\n\nOthers* It's Tigger's Birthday. The big 30\n* DFO Twitch Drop Event. Many concerns about not able to get all the Emotes. They are planning other things so you can get more. Not sure what.\n* DNF DUEL\uff5cGhostblade Play Video\n\nQ&A* There were no question summited via Discord. So this ExStream Duni and Tigger was free-styling.\n* Do you think the raids cap can be 1x per week but double the rewards. There is so much to do throughout the week and raid trains can take up a lot of time?\n+ This is a big raid content that they can't make comment at this moment, but can bring it up in meeting.\n\n* Are you going to provide support for DFO on Steam Deck (not through Steam)?\n+ Uhm, no one has asked that. Valid question, they will bring it up. But as for right now, nothing planned.\n\n* For the elven tales event, will you only have one chance each day to get the daily rewards? or can you can do it numerous times and gain more leaves?\n+ Yes, chance of getting reward remains same.\n\n* Will there be DNF duel rewards that translate to DFO?\n+ Doubt it.\n\n* Assault next week?\n+ Haha, did you even watch our Stream? Anyway, he's on the horizon.\n\n* Police avatars please?\n+ Maybe it's okay to bring it up again now.\n\n* There's a bug with binding multiple skills to the same command. It doesn't work unless you manually rebind them every time you log in. Sent in a report last month already...\n+ Will see if we can find that ticket or follow up\n\n* Will the ring (Elven Ring) effects be applied to the raid?\n+ That's for you to find out.\n\n* No finding MJ for this event in this year?\n+ I guess, who knows\n\n* Goth lollita avatars rerun prevision?\n+ KDnF has it. We don't know for DFOG\n\n* Is it possible to update the character creation preview to include Neo Awakening passive\/actives?\n+ Will consider, definitely\n\n\n\n","431":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2813\/Elven-Tales-Community-Contest?page=1\n\n","432":"\n\n* In order to keep this article short and sweet, I will assume you already know what Arad Pass works and what the general rewards are.\n* In case you still don't know what this is, DFOG already has a version of it here\u00a0Arad Pass Season 1.

Soul.\n+ The number of artifact raw materials that can be acquired is affected by the artifact's rarity and equippable level.\n+ All artifacts that were previously obtainable can also be dissembled\n\n  \n\n\nArtifact Creation* Artifacts can be crafted through the pop-up menu of Grandma Oran NPC <Create Artifact>.\n+ When creating artifacts, you can obtain rare to unique artifacts of level 50 or higher depending on the probability.\n\n* A total of 4 artifacts can be crafted at the same time.\n* Artifact crafting takes a total of 8 to 16 hours, and the longer the crafting time, the higher the probability of creating an artifact of higher rarity.\n* The materials required to craft 1 artifact are 100\u00a0\u00a0and 100k gold.\n* Artifact production cannot be canceled while in progress, and consumed materials will not be refunded.\n* While creating an artifact, you can shorten the production time by clicking the <Reduce Time> button.\n+ 5 Creature Souls are required per 1 hour of reduced time.\n+ If less than 1 hour is left, you will consume 5 Creature Souls to complete Artifact Crafting.\n\n  \n\n\nCreature Collection* A creature collection system is added. The collection is activated the first time you connect to the character with the creature.\n* In the Creature Collection, you can check the name of the acquired creature and the basic motion of the creature.\n+ Temporary creatures and some package hidden creatures are not included in the list.\n+ Creatures with the same appearance but with different options are registered in the collection as the same slot but have alternative name.\n  \n\n\nReferencesKDnF Test Server Note  \n[Tip] Persup Creature Contents  \nYouTube -\u00a0\ud788\uce74\ub9ac\ud0c0\ub9c8  \n\n\n","438":"\n\n* When Level 110 hit, how does one progress from previous cap? What about starting from scratch? No worries, I'll explain this level expansion for you.\n* Before we get to progression, it's important that you understand how the gear meta have changed and how these 240+ new epics works. Below is my plan of progression when 110 cap hit DFOG. If you see any error, let me know.\n* To read detail info about this cap, see this\u00a0Season 8: The Next Journey\u00a0post.\n\nTable of Contents* 110 Cap Summarized\n+ New Meta\n+ \"New\" Way to Get Epics\n+ How 105 Epic are Organized\n\n* How Do I Progress Now\n+ Start From Scratch\n+ Start as 100 Cap Graduate\n+ Start at Guide of Wisdom Graduate\n+ Final Milestones\n+ Some Final Info\n\n* References\n\n\n\nNew Meta* In previous level cap, all new epic equipment have a fixed stat. Whatever you get from dungeon and raids are that stat you're stuck with.\n* In level 100 cap, you get to use Raid epic gear such as Sirocco and Ozma pieces to fuse with your current gear, thus giving you more damage. But at the end of the day, whatever piece you fused, that stat doesn't change.\n* Until now, in level 110 Cap. These new epics can now levelled up and that piece will give you more stat. Along side what, damage mods (e.g. PMI, Bonus damage, Critical damage, etc.) are now merged into one called Damage Amplification.\n* In the picture below, you can feed un-used epic to your main piece to level it up. It doesn't even have to be a duplicate, any piece of the same slot will work.\n\n  \n\n\n\"New\" Way to Get Epics* This is not really new because we have seen this method before with the Spectre release.\n* Basically Spectre class had her own event dungeon. Here each of these sub event dungeons can drop epics at an insane rate, even mini-boss can drop level 100 epics. If you don't remember, there was even a website that guide you which dungeon drop which piece.\n\n* Now apply that to level 110 cap, it's every similar, all 10 new dungeons (Normal and Advance) can drop epic at any difficulty.\n\n* For the 8 normal dungeons, you now have 8 difficulties (Normal \u2192 King, then Heroes Normal \u2192 Heroes King). Each difficulty is progressively harder and requires more Adventure Fame to enter.\n* Well, Raven, if all of them drop epic, why do I need to clear harder difficulties?\n+ Higher difficulties will still have the same drop pool, but the Growth level of those epic will be higher. Therefore, for example, instead of getting level 2 Growth level epic, you get level 25 Growth level, that would save you time and materials to level it up.\n\n* Well, Raven, how do I know which of these 10 dungeon I should farm? I'll get to that.\n\n\n\nHow 105 Epic are Organized* Even though there are no set piece in 110 cap, all 240+ of them can be organized in 2 major categories: Fixed Option and Custom Option\n+ Fixed Option can further be sub-categorized as Normal and Advanced.\n\n* For your convenience, I have prepared this\u00a0Spreadsheet\u00a0so you can read about those epic.\n* Fixed Option Epics:\n+ When looking at the Spreadsheet, you will see that each item will have 4 Options, and those are for the most part unique to that pieces.\n+ You can have multiple pieces that can favor a specific build (e.g. Bleeding built, X-string built, etc) to your liking. That's why this 110 cap is so versatile.\n\n* Advanced Fixed Option Epics:\n+ These are still for the most part unique in their options but a bit more OP, and they can only drop from from Advance dungeons (Noblesse Code, Destroyed Castle of the Dead, and Meister's Laboratory).\n+ They are not necessary 2 or 3 times stronger than normal Fix-Option epics. You need to read their options and see which one worth swapping over.\n+ For example:\u00a0Tactical Drone Controller Armlet\u00a0, one single option increases Damage Amplification by 356 AND stacks up to 10. Granted it decreases your movement speed by a bunch, so use at your own risk.\n\nCustom Option Epics* These are unique in a way is that their Options are not pre-determined like Fixed Option. Rather when they drop, they get 4 out of a pool of options.\n* KDnF has a tier list of those custom option as well, but I'll let you judge for yourself which one you want. For example, \"Crit chance +5%\" option is pretty trash, duh.\n* Another perk is that you get to pick one of the 4 random option and change it. When a gear\u2019s option is replaced this way, the gear can no longer have its options replaced except for the option that was changed.\n+ In the left picture below, since this is a clean piece, you can pick any option to change. However, in the right picture, this piece already have option 1 changed, therefore, option 1 is the only one available to change again.\n\n* Replaceable options will be marked with yellow arrows next to them. Left pic is a clean piece, where as right pic has its Option 1 modified.\n\n* Where can you get these custom epic? Only from Normal dungeon at Hero difficulties and Advance dungeons at Expert difficulty or higher. Each slot has 3 possible custom epics and they're dropped in specific dungeons.\n* So What is the Point of Custom Option Epic?\n+ The main point is to reinforce a certain build (e.g. \"If 40% or lower HP, Skill Atk. +8%\" option when using\u00a0Suppressed Mana Bracelet\u00a0\u00a0piece). The possibility is endless. If you don't have a specific build, generic skill attack options are good too (e.g.\u00a0All lvl x skill atk +20%)\n\n* To learn more about this topic, visit this\u00a0Custom Epic Made Simple\u00a0post.\n\nWhat About Legendary Gear* You read that right, 110 cap also have Legendary Gear. But from what I have read, they're not really used to bridge your way to epic gear.\n* They are kinda the other way around. Legendary Gear can only be obtained in Advanced Dungeons Expert difficulty or higher. And they're tradable.\n* The main point of them is that their options are better than Normal Fixed Option epic. AND their option can also be transferred to Custom Option Epics.\n* So in a way, I guess if you don't have a good option to transfer, you can buy a legendary and transfer an option from there.\n\n\nHow Do I Progress Now\n\nStart From Scratch* This apply for players that have taken a long hiatus. Maybe you left at 86 cap and start to come back. Or maybe you leveling fresh character. This part is for you.\n* Start at normal dungeon difficulty Normal or Expert. They don't require a lot of Fame to enter.\n* Clearing those dungeons at Normal difficulty will give you entry level materials called\u00a0\u00a0Frost Crystal Fragments and its account bound version.\n+ If you don't already have some epic pieces, use these\u00a0\u00a0to start buying unique gears from NPC shop. Moreover, use these entry materials to start buying your basic enchants as well.\n+ Also don't forget to buy your Abyss swap set. I made a post about it a while ago, check it out.\n* Level 110 Normal dungeons at all difficulty also drop the next tier materials called\u00a0\u00a0Ominous Crystals\u00a0and its account bound version.\n+ Their main purpose is for purchasing Selective Level 105 Fixed Option epic box. Yes, if you don't get the piece you want, you can just trade\u00a0\u00a0for it. Getting epic at this cap is that easy. Each box cost 1,527\u00a0.\n+ Pro Tip: You can get more of these via daily mission. AND daily mission can be done PER CHARACTER. As you can see, the more alt you clear daily mission, the more\u00a0\u00a0you can funnel to your mains.\n\n  \n* Your next goal is to get enough fame to enter Advance dungeon (Noblesse Code and Destroyed Castle of the Dead)\n+ Normal dungeon Hero difficulty start at\u00a025,837\u00a0fame, where as Noblesse Code normal difficulty start at\u00a016,880 fame.\n+ Getting to 16,880 fame shouldn't be hard in this cap. So if you have 4 characters, I highly recommend you start doing Noblesse Code normal mode. Not only do they drop lot of epics, but you can pick and choose which piece to give to which alt. Thus gearing up multiple characters at the same time.\n+ These advance dungeons will drop the next tier materials called\u00a0\u00a0Red Dusk Crystals\u00a0and its account bound version. You can use this\u00a0\u00a0to buy Fixed Option Epic Selection box. This one is different than the one you buy with\u00a0\u00a0in a way that it include epics that drop from Noblesse Code and Destroyed Castle of the Dead (aka Advanced Fix Option Epics)\n\n* Your next goal here is to level up your epics and get to 25,837 fame. Looking at the table below, getting that fame will grant you access to Hero difficulty and Advance dungeon Expert.\n\n\n\n| Normal Dungeons | Noblesse Code | Destroyed Castle of the Dead |\n| King 21,675 | Normal 16,880 | Normal 17,612 |\n| Slayer 23,259 | Expert 23,788 | Expert 24,472 |\n| Hero Normal 25,837 | Master 27,483 | Master 30,267 |\n| Hero Expert 29,369 |  |  |\n| Hero Master 30,946 |  |  |\n| Hero King 32,523 |  |  |\n| Hero Slayer 33,989 |  |  |\n\n+ This is pretty much your end game farming (for now). These difficulties will start dropping Custom Option Epics to complement with your current set. This part is also pretty much lots of RNG. There is a big pool of custom option, so you don't always get the top tier options.\n+ At this high level difficulty is where you start seeing another tier material called\u00a0\u00a0Harmony Crystal. This is used to safely amp your gear where if you fail, the amp level doesn't decrease. You can read more about it here.\n+ A side content you should be doing around this progression is Storm's Wrath. This is a weekly dungeon that can drop epic with option level 30~60 and only require 25,407 to enter Expert level. These option level will boost your fame tremendously.\n\n  \n\n\nStart as 100 Cap Graduate* This part kind of depends on how strong and how many fame you have.\n* If you're a whale with 17-18k fame with full Sirocco, Ozma, and BP gear. You can go straight to Destroyed Castle of the Dead Normal mode. Here's an example of 18.5k Male Nen clearing Normal Destroyed Castle of the Dead.\n\n  \n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \n* Along side with Normal mode Advance dungeon, do normal dungeons at the highest difficulty you can to start gathering your 105 epics.\n* If you don't have enough fame, myself for example, my main is at 16,101 fame. With the mythic reworks, I probably would have a bit higher fame. Normal Castle needs 17,612 fame, so I would start at normal dungeons Master difficulty (requires 13,195 fame).\n* Then try to make your way to 25,837\u00a0fame for those higher level dungeons to get Custom Option Epics.\n* You can also feed your Ozma fused gear, Sirocco Fused gear, and Max BP gear to 105 epic.\n\n\n\nStart at Guide of Wisdom Graduate* This would apply to a lot of my lower tier alts. Those are the character at about 12-13k fame.\n* Here you're probably strong enough to solo Oculus party mode or enough to get to Sirocco green party.\n* Here I would start with Normal dungeon Master difficulty if you have enough fame. If not, then start at Expert difficulty. Then follow the normal route mentioned above.\n\n\n\nFinal Milestones* Hitting 33,043 Fame grants you access to the first Legion dungeon, Ispins. This dungeon drop option level 50~70, which can help boost you fame.\n+ This is the area where you acquire\u00a0\u00a0Quad-Color Split Energy for your fusion epics\u00a0for your Accessory slots.\n+ Every dragon you kill here will give you 1 Tales of Bravery which can be converted into Conqueror's Token and used to buy various goods from NPC Flo. Some good items includes +30 Elemental damage Magic Stone Bead and Ispins Fixed-option epics.\n\n* Hitting 34,308 Fame grants you access to Machine's Revolution: Total War.\u00a0This dungeon drop option level 60~65, which can help boost you fame.\n+ This is the area where you acquire\u00a0\u00a0Cruel King of Dragons' Seal for your\u00a0fusion epics\u00a0for your Armor slots.\n+ Here you will get another version Tales of Bravery which can be converted into Conqueror's Token and used to buy various goods from\u00a0NPC Flo. Some good items includes Warped Dimension Cube and Total War Fixed-option epics.\n  \n  \n\n\nSome Final Info* Golden Beryl\u00a0is another materials used for option growth, transfer and level transfer of epics. They can drop at any normal dungeon difficulty. However, the tradable version\u00a0\u00a0Flawless Golden Beryl only drops in Advance dungeons.\n* Level 110 cap comes with a Revamped Encyclopedia. Make sure to use it to look up where to get each epic piece.\n+ From a quick glance,\u00a0Vericollis Temple drops lots of Accessories and Special Equipment. Whereas\u00a0Nasau Forest drops a lot more armor pieces.\n\n* Advance dungeons require Entry Ticket and FP to enter. These Tickets require Play Points\u00a0to buy. You get 1 Play Point for every 30 FP spent. So it's in your best interest to burn all FP everyday. If I don't have time to play that day, I would use FP Express to burn them off in normal dungeons. Those ticket don't expire, so stock them up on your busy day then use them on your free day.\n+ With the\u00a0The Meister's Laboratory\u00a0update, you no longer get Play Point from spending FP . Instead you get 10 Points from completing daily limited mission.\n\n* Keep your 100 cap Mythic. They got revamped and got a huge Fame boost. You can still use them for a while before being replaced with good Custom-Option epics.\nCongrats* You have reached the end of this progression guide. Really at the end of the day, it depends on your fame. You now know the general path. Now pick the appropriate dungeon difficult.\n\n\nReferences105 Epic Farming Guide!  \nChangelog  \n* 3\/26\/2023: Added some final milestones.\n* 7\/12\/2022: Apparently you will need to clear the optimal dungeon to get the play point\n* 5\/1\/2022: Adjusted fame requirements for various dungeon difficulties.\n* 4\/11\/2022: Add some clarification on Advanced Fix-Option Epics. They are not necessary 2 or 3 times stronger than normal Fix-Option epics.

However, if multi-attribute switching is attempted within the dungeon, unexpected settings may be affected, so a limit on the number of times has been applied.\n\n* Cube's contract is immediately re-applied when resurrected after death in the dungeon\n* Level 95 equipment is changed to be able to be engraved directly on level 105 equipment.\n+ The cost is the same as engraving from level 95 to level 100 equipment and then to level 105 equipment.\n* Effect is added when you acquire the equipment you favorited from the equipment dictionary. Limited to Epic and Mythic equipment.\n\n* When searching for an item, materials and parts other than the item name are also changed to be searchable.

However, we tried to avoid changing the settings as much as possible due to this adjustment, so the setting was intended to be at a level that could still be considered in options with other settings. And we made adjustments to items that were judged to need additional adjustments.\n+ First, we have relaxed the condition of the recovery option due to the combo conditional or multi-hit so that the character centered on single-hit mechanic does not suffer as much.\n+ In the process, we have determined that the \"Necklace Of Exalted Fury\"\u00a0\u00a0and some custom epic options are over-balanced, so we have slightly lowered the figures.\n+ If all items are upgraded to match excessive performance, new settings will be created in the process, which can be a burden on adventurers, so we want to keep the changes within a stable range as much as possible.\n+ In addition, only items that were judged to require some upgrades were upgraded, and for equipment with excessive conditions and penalties, conditions and penalties were alleviated to enable smoother use.\n+ Lastly, due to the nature of the damage increase option, in order to alleviate the negative play feeling of damage increase getting lower as the option level increases, a skill attack increase option that is applied from a certain option level or higher has been added.\n\n* All changes are highlighted in

options are adjusted.\n+ Since the 3rd and 4th options of all fixed option epic equipment are designed to use the custom option as it is, adjusting the custom option causes the performance of the fixed option epic equipment to change in the same way.\n+ However, it is not intended to change the performance of the fixed option epic equipment, so we have adjusted the option values \u200b\u200bto have the same effect as the existing specifications as much as possible.\n+ This was adjusted for the same purpose for some equipment, such as the 'Knight's Pride' item reflected in the existing first server, and there was a part that caused confusion due to the lack of explanation.\n\n\n\n| Name | Before | After |\n| Black Flower's Restraint Bracelet(\ud751\ud654\uc758 \uad6c\uc18d \ud314\ucc0c) |

It was necessary to respond to various issues that occurred after the max level expansion, and to improve convenience that was not taken care of in advance.\n* After a meeting with the staff, while chatting, I heard the words, \u201cI am busy working for the max level expansion, so I can\u2019t do it on weekdays, and I don\u2019t have time to do housework on the weekends because I am busy.\u201d I was proud and saddened by the development staff who continued to work hard after the update.\n* What is particularly encouraging is that not only those who have played DnF in the past, but also a lot of new\/returned adventurers. In addition, existing adventurers are also called Dunlin, and we are very grateful for the help and interest in the settlement of new\/returned adventurers.\n* We may not have been perfect, but we are really happy with the many people called Dunlin while producing content called Elvenmere that is about to be updated tomorrow, planning an event, organizing a package, preparing a convenience update, etc.\n* I think the part that had the biggest impact on adventurers was probably the item reorganization.\n* Among the various options for items, if not modified, there were some that would cause serious balance problems in the future, and some items that are expected to be highlighted according to the change of the future meta.\n* As I said at the last festival, even if you have a bit of a crazy time in the beginning of the cap, you should fix the items that cause serious balance problems in the future so that it will not negatively affect adventurers with other settings. Because of this, it was inevitable to proceed with revisions several times.\n* Even before the revision, there were adventurers who were satisfied with the options and had a lot of fun, so it seems that the unavoidable revision caused inconvenience and anxiety a lot. I apologize once again.\n* And after the item reorganization to be carried out tomorrow, we do not intend to proceed with the large-scale item modification similar to the previous one.\n\nFuture Direction* Also, there are a few things that are still under development and are under discussing.\n* It's about independent objects. From the past to the present, there has been a problem in that characters who mainly use independent objects do not receive the option of triggerable items properly.\n+ We don't know all the history of this, but if we simply modify it, the balance can be shifted, and problems such as huge lag can occur, so we are approaching it with caution, but we are currently working hard to improve it.\n+ In the near future, we will accelerate the pace of development so that we can introduce it to adventurers through related patch notes.\n\n* We are also carefully reviewing your comments on the difficulty of dungeons.\n+ It requires some combination of settings as well as acquiring certain epic equipment to go from expert to master.\n+ We plan to lower the Master Difficulty and King Difficulty so that you can move up to the upper level more smoothly. So we're trying to alleviate some of that problem.\n+ We plan to maintain the gap between Normal and Heroes to some extent so that Heroes can become more challenging content.\n+ Master and King difficulty adjustments will be reflected immediately this week, but setting a new difficulty level will take a little longer.\n\n* In addition, problems such as incomplete settings, which are one of the other factors that increase the entry barrier for new characters or adventurers, will be continuously alleviated by adding helpful content, starting with Elvenmere, which will be updated this time. Please support this as well.\n* And, as previously mentioned, the new advanced dungeon, Meister's Lab, will be introduced through the first server in early May.\n+ We know that new dungeons, cool patterns, attractive monsters, and rewards or equipment that can be obtained are always a part of high expectations and interest, and we are doing our best to meet those expectations, especially this time at the max level. As adventurers received a lot of favorable reviews about the story through the expansion, we are working hard to create depth of fun in the story aspect as well.\n\n* Lastly, I was thinking about giving something to give as a token of appreciation for the fact that so many adventurers love and enjoy DnF. I've seen a lot of comments about the cute SD mask avatar that I recently gave as an event reward.\n+ So, I would like to proceed with the Spring Attendance Check event right away so that you can acquire the item once more. It was a decision I made hastily because I wanted to respond to the voice you give me, even a little, but I hope you like it.\n\n* I think it is really important to give you trust by showing how the parts I talked about in the developer notes, DnF Festival, or DnF ON are implemented step by step.\n+ Until now, except for some content that is judged to be better to be provided at a less burdensome time by adjusting the schedule, such as a creature reorganization, everyone is doing their best to keep the roadmap I mentioned earlier.\n+ We will do our best to repay you with higher quality by not repeating the disappointing parts in this max level expansion update, and continuing the popular parts.\n+ We would like to once again thank all adventurers who are always with us. Please give a lot of love and support to our development team, who are working hard day and night to make the most prosperous year even before the max level expansion.\n\nReferencesKDnF Director's Note  \n\n\n","448":"\n\n* Just a simple event.

You can click on the \"Buff Enhancement\" book, then register your swap gear.\n\n* How Does It Work?\n+ The swap set basically increases the level and stat of your buff skill (e.g.\u00a0).\n+ Back in the old days before this UI, you would have to equip the swap set, go into dungeon, cast you buff skill, then swap back into your damage gears. This Swap UI will do all that work for you.\n\nWhat Goes In the Swap UI?---Equipment---* The first pieces to the swap set that anyone can get are the equipment slots. These items are highlighted below and come from Operation: Hope dungeon.\n* This dungeon can be found in Closed Area in Harlem. Each character can enter it 3 times per week.\n\n* While running the dungeon, be sure to follow the path with the quest scroll (circled in red) because it will lead to you the area needed to complete the internal quest. By doing so you can get more\u00a0Abyss Fragment\u00a0\u00a0at the end.\n\n* can be used to buy swap set from NPC Ceberin. This is where you buy your weapon, armor, accessory, and special equipment pieces.\n\n* Weapon:\n+ There are 2 versions: regular and \"S\" version. The regular\u00a0can be upgraded to the \"S\" version, which give more stat. In the example below, the \"S\" version is about 4% stronger.\n\n+ To upgrade the weapon, you can buy the recipe from Ceberin. This recipe gives you an RNG chance of upgrading to \"S\". Cost 20\u00a0\u00a0and 100\u00a0\u00a0for each roll. Make sure you buy the correct recipe that matches your weapon type.\n\n+ Each fail attempt will give one\u00a0\u00a0. Basically 10\u00a0\u00a0will give guarantee \"S\" weapon using Conversion Scroll\u00a0.\n\n* Armor\u00a0and Accessory: Generic boxes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for all classes. When you open these boxes, the system will automatically select your class. So you don't have to worry about selecting the right one.\n* Special Equipment: This part is a bit more tricky. Here you have 3 options to pick\u00a0\u00a0Encroached set,\u00a0\u00a0Distorted set, and\u00a0\u00a0Warped set. Encroached gives you +3 level but offer minimal stat, whereas Warped gives +1 level but offer maximal stat. And Distorted is kind of in the middle. So you need to pick which one based on your budget.\n+ gives the most skill level but doesn't give any skill stat. You save money not to buy other skill level such as platinum emblem, title.\n+ gives the least skill level but most skill stat. You will need spend money on buying skill title and platinum emblem.\n+ What I recommend for new players is to pick Encroached set. Then as you get more in the end game and start to min-max, you can switch to Warped set.\n\n---Title---* Titles come in many shapes and sizes. Most buff swap titles add levels to your skill through 2 ways. (1) It straight adds level to the skill itself. (2) It adds level from the level range.\n* In the example below, this is a swap title for Mistress, whose buff skill is called \"Seven Deadly Sins\". Because this buff skill is a level 20 skill, when a Mistress uses this title, it will add 3 levels to her buff skill.\n\n* These swap titles usually come from seasonal packages and can cost quite a bit a gold to obtain, especially the price different between +2 and +3 title. Depends on the class, +2 title can cost you about 30 million gold, and +3 title can cost up to 70~80 million.\n* One of the beginner package from the webstore comes with a +2 title that may worth your money. If you don't want to spend cash, I would recommend waiting for the price on the auction hall to drop and maybe you get lucky and get something cheap within your budget.\n\n---Avatar---* This is where you can add up to 4 levels to the buff skill. 1 level from Rare Top, Rare Bottom, and Aura, with 1 level from the \"Ability\" section from Top avatar. Platinum emblems can be found in the Auction Hall and through Lost Treasure as\u00a0Selective Platinum Emblem Box.\n* Top & Bottom Avatars: Rare avatars (clone or non-clone) have slot to add platinum emblem onto them.\n* Aura: Only specific auras have plat emblem slot. So watch out for sales and packages from Neople.\n* In the example below, each plat emblem add 1 level to Male Ranger buff skill, Death by Revolver. With +1 from the \"Ability\" option in the Rare Top avatar, this set will give +4 level.\n\n---Creature---* Very similar to title, Pet can add level either straight up or through a skill level range. In the example below, Petite Ms. Black (left) adds level though level 15-35 range, whereas Petite Raven (right) adds level directly to the skill.\n\n* Again just like title, these pets often from from seasonal packages and sales, so watch out for them when they come around.\n\nExample Using My Male Ranger\n* NOTE: The MAX level you can add for non-sader classes is +10.\n* Equipment:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for armor and accessory,\u00a0\u00a0warped set for special equipment,\u00a0\u00a0\"S\" revolver.\n* Title: +2 from \"Awakened Ones All-in-One Package\" from the webstore.\n* Avatar: Rare top, bottom avatar with aura\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and 3 plat emblems\u00a0.\n* Creature:\u00a0\u00a0Petit Raven.\n* Total: +10 skill levels\n\nDo I Really Need Swap Set?* YES YES YES. Below is an example of 20-sec sandbag WITH swap set (57 Bil) vs. NO swap set (41 Bil).\n\nException to the Guide* Sader classes (Crusader, Seraph, Enchantress) are the exception. They don't use \"Operation: Hope\" gear and their max level to buff skill is +30 instead.\n* Generally speaking\n+ Swap gear is the one that give most stat and level to buff skill (e.g.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0)\n+ Actual gear is the one that give most level to 1st Awakening skill (e.g.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0)\n\n  \nChangelog* 9\/26\/2021: Reworked this page to include more explanation than just plain bullet points.\n\n\n","457":"\n\n\n\n\n\nTown\nwest\\_coast\\_alliance\\_camp.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n","458":"\n* Overview\n+ There are no new content updates with this patch\n\n* Events\n+ Honey Time\n+ Treasures of the Deep\n+ Where's Adventurer?\n\n* Sale\n+ Canna's Season 1 Limited Sales Shop\n\n* Comments\n+ IMPORTANT: Mileage reset on July 21\n+ Filler events until we get the next 3rd Awakening update.\n+ All events and safari package are set to end on July 21, which most likely the time when the next 3A is released.\n\n\n\n","459":"\n  \nNoticeThe author has requested peer review in the Male Launcher discord group\u00a0but couldn't get a review from anyone.

The Machine Revolution: Total War, Archon set up is very easy to use and very newbie friendly. Archon comes from\u00a0Starcraft's unit\u00a0where it has very little HP. The main piece for this set up is\u00a0\u00a0Suppressed Mana Bracelet, which reduce your HP to 1% and allow incoming damage to consume MP instead of HP.\n+ To increase survivability, it's recommend to add\u00a0\u00a0Reversible Leather Coat and\u00a0\u00a0Accelerator to increase MP recovery.\n+ With new player, below is the recommendation for Normal Dungeon epic since you may not have enough\u00a0\u00a0Shattered Red Dusk Crystal yet.\n* Once you have enough\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shattered Red Dusk Crystal from Advance dungeon (e.g. Destroyed Castle of the Dead). Start replacing your Shoulder and Belt piece\n+ Replace\u00a0\u00a0Ender's Gaze with\u00a0\u00a0Manipulation\n+ Replace\u00a0\u00a0Genius Engineer's Multi-tool Belt with\u00a0\u00a0Power Plant\n\n* When you get a bit more advanced, start to move forward to Meister and Custom-open epics.\n+ Replace\u00a0\u00a0Chaos Curtains with\u00a0\u00a0Robotica Combat Pants, note that you will need high level Ampification \/ Reinforcement for this to work.\n+ Promised Time for Victory from Ispins is also a good replacement\n+ The following are just some examples but you can read more in this\u00a0Custom Epic Made Simple. Don't forget that Total War patch also have some custom epic line changes.\n\n\n\n| \u00a0Ent Spirit Top(This\u00a0is mine now) | \u00a0Ent Spirit\u00a0Sub Equipment |\n| Must Have Line:If more than 40% HP, Physical\/Magical Def. +25,000 and Critical Chance -8%If 40% or lower HP, Skill Atk. +8%.

(Cooldown: 1 sec.)Other Good Lines:-\u00a0MP +3.500 on every attack (Cooldown: 1 sec.)-\u00a0All classes' Lv. 75 skill range +15%, All classes' Lv. 75 skill Atk. +5% | Must Have Line:If more than 40% HP, Fire Resistance +40If 40% or more HP, Skill Atk. +5%Other Good Lines:-\u00a0Skill Atk. +7%\u00a0 when attacking Dragon enemies-\u00a0Skil Atk. +4% if your highest Damage-type Status effect's Additional Damage value is less than 20% |\n\n  \n* And then at the final end game, we start to get to Fusion Epic from Ispins \/ Total War \/\u00a0Archmage's Dimensional Corridor. Below is just one of many example being used. I highly recommend you read individual pieces to see which one work best for your set up.\n  \nChangelog* 3\/2\/23:\n+ UPDATED: various info to match 110 cap\n\n* 7\/25\/20\n+ ADDED: Headshot mechanic\n\n* 7\/14\/20\n+ ADDED: Acknowledgement statement\n\n\n","465":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Male Gunner classes.

Black Shrine there was clearly the winner overall.\n* In this analysis, let's see how 400 runs of Black Shrine compare to 400 runs of Stormy Route.\n\nProcedure* The author had ran out of NeoPremium, with 156 fp plus pot, the author ran 20 runs on each character\u00a0 for easy calculation.\n* Repair cost was not included for the sake of consistency.\n\n* Gabriel Shop\n+ The author only bought items that are valuable for this analysis such as\n+ were not bought due to their minimal affect on this calculation.\n\n* No Purple Card Flip\n+ The author started doing no card flip midway through the analysis, so keep it that way for consistency.\n+ Realistically would be better if this card flip is included.\n\nTerminology* Total Raw Gold\u00a0- sum of\u00a0\u00a0from dungeon drops, card flips, selling white\/blue\/purple drops, and tradeable items such as\u00a0\u00a0, excluding card drops.\n* Time's Guide Stone Gold\u00a0- Theoretical cost of\u00a0\u00a0in term of character progression.\n* One Free Hell\u00a0- One Hell run after about 18 dungeon runs. It's the theoretical cost of 18\u00a0\u00a0in term of character progression.\n* Total Progression Gold\u00a0- The sum of all theoretical and raw golds (i.e. Total Raw Gold + Time's Guide Stone Gold + One Free Hell)\n* Jackpot\u00a0- An occurrence of \"Capricious Demon Prion\" aka this guy:\n\n  \nThe Data  \n  \n  \nDiscussion* Black Shrine\n+ Much easier to clear. 30 billion damage should have no problem clearing comfortably.\n+ Has chance of epic drop.\n+ Has chance of great card drop such as Ash Rosenberg\u00a0, Medium Airag\u00a0, Kazan-possessed Rosenberg\u00a0.\n+ Drop Time Crystal, which is one of the main source of income.\n\n* Stormy Route\n+ Much harder to clear comfortably.\n+ A lot of the bosses in this place can one shot you easily if don't one shot them first. There are also lots of annoying gimmicks suck as stun, freeze, I-frame. For example:\n- Evanescent Ferman\u00a0: Stun and I-frame\n- Hammer King Borodin\u00a0: Stun and I-frame\n- Guardian Rime\u00a0: Close to 100 % freeze with ice spike\n- Hyper Mecha Tau\u00a0: Stun and I-frame\n- Giant Nugol\u00a0: Bleeding\n- Pandemos Floo\u00a0: I-frame\n\n+ 35-40 billion damage is the cutline to clear.\n- 45-50 billion damage is recommended.\n- 30 billion damage is really pushing it, brave yourself to burn life tokens with that damage.\n\n* In Term of Raw Gold\n+ Stormy Route wins per average run.\n+ But you're looking at a 11.6% difference here.\n+ But keep in mind this is pre-Sirocco raid. Due to entry ticket costing 30\u00a0, the price may increase when the raid comes out.\n\n* In Term of Progression Gold\n+ Stormy Route wins with jackpots. Without jackpots, both dungeons are not far apart.\n+ You're looking at a higher gap of 36.3% here.\n\n* In Term of Efficiency\n+ The main argument here is that Black Shrine has epic drop as an advantage, but at the same time Stormy Route also drop more\u00a0, which translate to additional Guide of Wisdom runs, which require FP to run.\n+ Since level 100 epics are the main point of progression. The author will use epic chance per FP ratio as comparison\n+ If the epic drop chance is the same in 2+2, regular Black Shrine runs, and Guide of Wisdom (BIG\u00a0FAT\u00a0IF),\u00a0we all know it's not true, but for the shake of the analysis, the author will designate each epic chance as\n+ to\u00a0FP ratio\n- Black Shrine\n* Since Black Shrine builds up Guide of Wisdom gauge, 400 runs would give you 420\u00a0. Also technically speaking, the first 2 runs give double\u00a0, one from boss kill, one from card flip. So 400 runs will give 460\n* 400 runs yields 481\u00a0\u00a0and 116\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a033\n* 22,679,742 raw\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4 240\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a013\n* Total: 506\n* Total FP: 3,200 from 400 runs + 264 from 33\u00a0\u00a0+ 104 from 13\u00a0\u00a0= 3550\n* Grand Final: 0.14\u00a0\u00a0per FP\n\n- Stormy Route\n* 400 runs yields 1070\u00a0\u00a0and zero\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a059\n* 19,238,588 raw\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4 203\u00a0\u00a0\u27a4\u00a011\n* Total: 70\n* Total FP: 3,200 from 400 runs + 472 from 59\u00a0\u00a0+ 88 from 11\u00a0\u00a0= 3,760\n* Grand Final: 0.02\u00a0\u00a0per FP\n\n+ Black Shrine wins by the long shot with x7.66\u00a0 more efficient.\n\nRecommendation* If all you care about is raw gold, farm Stormy. Even though the raw gold is not far apart, with Sirocco raid coming soon, the price\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0will likely to increase. Stormy will give you more bang for your buck.\n* If all you care about is progression, still farm Stormy. It give you more progression in term of gold. HOWEVER, if you factor in RNG, Black Shrine is way more efficient in term of\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0FP ratio.\n\nTL;DR* Black Shrine is easier to clear, yield similar raw gold with great progression efficiency.\n* Stormy Route is harder to clear, yield slightly higher raw gold, higher gold progression but with terrible efficiency.\n  \n\n\n","467":"\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Dimension\ndark\\_dimension\\_erlox.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nDungeon\ndark\\_dimension.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nBoss\ndark\\_dimension\\_darkevil.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n","468":"\n\n* Ever looked into the 100 epic equipment and got overwhelmed?\n* Which one is the best in slot for my character?\n* What would be the best bang for your buck in term of damage increase?\n* This post provides general guidelines to help you with your gearing and spending decision in the end game.\n\nEquation For Basic Skill Damage* This Reddit page\u00a0explains clearly how damage is calculated but let's look at it in a simplest way possible.\n* This was was last edited 3 years ago, so it may be outdated, but this is the only equation the author can find.\n\nIf you get a critical hit, just take this and \u27161.5* Yellow\n+ \n+ Depends on if your character is percent damage or fixed damage.

The worst part is this system is required for endgame contents. Don't expect to get accepted into party if you don't have any talisman.\n\nHow Does This System Work?* This system is designed to customize and strengthen your skills.\n* You can open this system through the \"Talisman\" tab in the inventory window.\n\n* Upon opening the \"Talisman\" tab, you will see Picture 1. The green squares are for Talismans. The blue circles are for Runes. Clicking the Book (circled in red) will open up Picture 2 and 3. Picture 2 is the list of the current 5 talismans. Picture 3 will give all available runes.\n\n* So this system consists of 2 parts: Talismans and Runes.\n* Talismans:\n+ Currently with the Pandemonium War patch, there are 5 talismans for each class, and you can only equip 2 talismans. Korea added a 3rd slot with the \"Black Church\" update.\n+ Each talisman comes in 2 rarity: \"Rare\" and \"Unique\". You can read their descriptions and demonstrations in the section at the bottom.\n+ Each talisman also has 3 rune slots, and the colors are randomized between 5 colors. More info in the runes section below.\n+ Generally speaking, the best talisman would consist of Red, Blue, and Violet rune slots. This is where the RNG is worst. The talisman itself is RNG to get, and the rune slots are also RNG.\n\n* Runes:\n+ Looking at Picture 3, there are multiple skills that has runes.\n+ Each skill has 5 possible colors, and each color has 3 rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare):\n- Violet runes increase attack damage\n- Green runes reduce attack damage and also reduce cooldown\n- Blue runes only reduce cooldown\n- Yellow runes only increase range\n- Red runes increase attack damage and also increase cooldown\n\n+ Reading through each runes, the 3 most desired colors are\u00a0\u00a0for each talisman.\n\n* Example using male ranger:\n+ Two popular talismans for male ranger are\u00a0Acceleration Revolver and\u00a0Double Grinder.\n+ In Picture 4, you can see that the colors for those 2 talismans are not best-in-slot. The author has Blue Red for top talisman and Violet Red for bottom talisman.\n+ Upon equipping the appropriate color runes, the talismans will light up (Picture 5) and activate all their effects.\n+ The author picked\u00a0\u00a0runes because it's one of the highest DPS skill. Even then you could see that the author still has works to do because both Red runes and one Green rune are still at Uncommon rarity.\n\n  \nHow to Acquire Talismans and Runes* Talismans and runes are drops from Pandemonium War dungeon.\n* You need to be level 95 to access this content through its specific channel.\n\n  \n* There are plenty of guides out there explaining the mechanics. You can learn more through this\u00a0dungeon guide page.\n* Of course this dungeon drops talismans and runes among all kinds. So with the unwanted drops, you can use them for crafting other talismans and runes through \"Monica of the Library\" NPC.\n* The \"My Class\" option will only use talismans and runes specifically for your class. The author recommend only use this option if you have multiple duplicates or if you know for sure you don't use any of them.\n\n* Other ways to get talismans and runes include buying from mileage shop and explorer shop using Glory Crystals.\n\n  \n  \nThe Terrible RNG System  \n* To give you an idea of the RNG with this system, we need to see how big the drop pool is.\n* For Talismans:\n+ With 61 sub-classes and 5 talismans for each sub-class, there are 305 possible drops.\n+ Each talisman has 2 rarities, drop pool increased to 610.\n+ So the chance of drop for the desired Unique talisman from clearing Pandemonium War dungeon is 0.16%. AND that doesn't account for the combination of rune colors. 5 colors give 10 possible combination of 3-colors.\n+ Therefore, the chance of the desired drop is\u00a00.16%.\u00a0And when that drops, the chance of the best-in-slot color combination is\u00a010%.\n\n* For Runes:\n+ Each class has a set number of skill that have runes. Ranging from 9 skills (Female Nen) to 17 skills (Summoner).\n+ Using Female Nen as example: 9 skills, with 5 color runes, with 3 rune rarities give 135 drop pool.\n+ Even if we assume all 61 sub-classes have 9 skills, that still give a pool of\u00a08,235\u00a0possible drops.\n+ Therefore, without compounding, the chance of each desired rune is\u00a00.012%.\n+ Although clearing Challenge mode will drop about 25 runes, so that increase your chances a bit.\n\nDescriptions and Demonstrations for Each Talisman* You can access these information along with their popularity ranking through this\u00a0Talisman Archive\u00a0page.\n\n\n","474":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Female Fighter classes.

Definitely not Best-In-Slot but still good.\n- The 1A skill image skin boxes are great for collector like me. However, with the release of more and more 3A, not many classes will be casting 1A to take advantage of these skin boxes.\n- The Special Equipment boxes are decent and slightly better than level 100 legendary.\n- The complete guide can be found in this link\n\n+ Elemental Heroes Package\n- This is gear toward sader classes.\n- Hidden creature is great due to +75 all stat along with both buff and 1A skill level but requires RNG to roll.\n- The Aura is also great due to +100 all stat along with 1A skill level but requires 6 coins to buy (aka ~$84 USD for an aura)\n\n\n","475":"\n\n* Have you ever looked at the Challenge tab in the explorer club and wonder what does the \"Adventure Motion Aura Avatar\" look like?\n\n* To be able to get it you will need to get all subclasses of that class to Savior training level.\n* This post will give you a rough estimate of how long it would take to get there.\n\nProcedure and Data* With the update of level 100 cap (Season 6 Act 1: Ascension), the character training level cap has been changed.\n\n* We know that each training level requires a set amount of EXP, and they increase exponentially.\n* Since there is no one in the DFOG server have reached Savior training, it's impossible to know how much EXP is needed. However, the author does have the EXP needed for lower levels and was able to find out a rough estimate of the EXP scaling.\n* Data sample:\n+ Challenger level 14 requires 1,731,676 EXP\n+ Challenger level 15 requires 1,800,943 EXP\n+ Challenger level 16 requires 1,872,981 EXP\n+ Challenger level 17 requires 1,947,900 EXP\n+ Challenger level 18 requires 2,025,816 EXP\n+ Challenger level 19 requires 2,106,849 EXP\nResult and Discussion* The author divided the EXP of one level to the previous level, the ratio turned out to be 1.04, which mean with each level, the EXP required will increase by 1.04\n* The author took this ratio and scale it up all the way to Savior level and got an estimate of the total EXP needed, however, there were some roadblocks. When comparing theoretical and actual EXP from the author's alts, the difference turned to be off by a few levels. For example:\n+ Expert level 33 should require 22,238,447 EXP, but the exact amount is 24,930,662 EXP (a.k.a. theoretical EXP required for level 36)\n+ Leader level 40 should require 171,196,329 EXP, but the exact amount is 224,182,043 EXP (a.k.a. theoretical EXP required for level 48)\n+ Guru level 16 should require 424,826,869 EXP, but the exact amount is 491,210,463 EXP (a.k.a theoretical EXP required for level 20)\n\n* When scaling up to Savior training and add them all together, the estimated cumulative EXP required turned out to be 2,485,533,761,335 EXP (that's 2.5 TRILLION). And with the roadblocks explained above, we know that we're at least underestimating this number. The author wouldn't be surprise if it turn out to be 3 trillion.\n\nHow Long Would it Take?* After running various level 100 cap dungeons, which require only 8 FP each, the author concluded that Ghent Palace Expert full clear yield the highest amount which is about 10.5 million EXP, not including EXP from each monster kill. Disaster Sector 3 also gives good EXP, but the it takes way too many FP to clear.\n* Assuming you have 156 FP bar, only 19 Ghent dungeons can be cleared in a day without using FP pot, which translate to roughly 34 years of clearing 19 Ghent Palace EVERYDAY.\n* AGAIN, between roadblocks and not including EXP from monster kills, we probably will still underestimate the result. How long does it actually take? looks like we'll never know.\n\nTL;DR* If you want to finish all the challenges from the character tab, you will need to get all 61 subclasses to Savior training, which will require you to clear 19 Ghent Palace Expert full runs on each of the 61 characters EVERYDAY for at least 34 years. If it takes 30 seconds to clear the dungeon, that's about 10 hours of playtime everyday for 34 years.\n* GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN!!!\n\nCredit* Thumbnail medal pictures credit to DFO Wiki\n\n  \n---EDIT Feb. 3rd, 2021---* The reason for the EXP discrepancy has been found.\n* In\u00a0this EXP sheet, it only has LEADER up to level 44, not 49 as indicated in DFO patch note.\n\n* And if you compare my alt in the image below, who is at Guru 17, the EXP match 100%.\n* Therefore, the error is that Neople claims the EXP level is changed to LEADER level 49, but in reality, it only scale up to LEADER level 44.\n\n\n","476":"\n\n* The goal of this article is to present all the information as effective as possible.

Bringing the health to zero will clear the raid.\n* As you're fighting the 3 forms, you will see Sirocco's health showing multiple colors. They are indication of damage for each colored party. As an example below, yellow party is the one doing the most damage.\n\n  \nThe Inner Layer* Three forms of Sirocco: Snake, Queen, and Leste\n+ After each groggy phase, the location of each form is randomized between 3\u00a0Consciousness.\n+ However, the clockwise order of 3 forms is always the same: Snake > Leste > Queen\n+ So even though it's randomized, if you know the location of one, you know the location of all three. Even if the\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0rotate, the order still remain same. Credit to\u00a0kdnf forum.\n\n\nThe Outer Layer* The purpose of 3 True Subconscious\u00a0outer layer dungeons are to set up groggy phase.\n* True Subconscious\u00a0is further spit into three type: Denial, Oppression, and Oblivion.\n+ Denial (Boss:\u00a0Sirocco's Nightmare)\n- If not cleared within the time limit, phase 2 will reset back to 3rd layer.\n- Once clear, the dungeon will re-spawn after 2 mins 30 secs.\n\n+ Oppression (Boss:\u00a0Kain Assassin in the Fog)\n- If cleared, the three\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0will rotate clockwise and is used to set up Resonance.\n\n+ Oblivion (Boss:\u00a0Roxy)\n- If clear at the state of Resonance, it will activate 25-sec groggy phase for Sirocco\n- Think of this dungeon as Observatory dungeon in Prey-Isys raid.\n\n\n\nHow to Activate 25-sec Groggy Phase* This phase can only be activated when the alignment of one\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0and\u00a0Subconscious: Oblivion are at Resonance phase. Once it's in place, clear\u00a0Subconscious: Oblivion will active groggy.\n* There are 2 ways to know the Resonance phase is in place:\n+ Pop-up video plays in the corner.\n\n+ The color changes in the map between\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0and\u00a0Subconscious.\n\n* So keep clearing\u00a0Subconscious: Oppression\u00a0to rotate\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0until the correct one line up. Once activated, all 3\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0merged and groggy phase start.\n* In simple terms, keep clearing\u00a0Kain dungeon until things line up, then send Roxy.\n  \nWhat Happen After the Groggy Phase* Very similar to Prey-Isys Raid, after the 25-sec, all parties in TC will be kicked out and have to wait 150 seconds to re-enter.\n* Basically you repeat the Resonance process until Sirocco is defeated.\n\n\n\nDungeon MechanicsPhase 1Phase 2  \n\n\nRaid Cutline & Recommended Gears* Since DFOG doesn't have API website, there's no way anyone can tell how much damage you can do in a 25-sec rotation just by looking at your gear.\n* Thus what you wear will determine if you're a strong applicant in the eye of a raid leader.\n\nFor DPS classes  \n* Weapon\n+ Level 100 epic weapon with +12 reinforcement\/+8 refinement.\n+ Sirocco Primal Dream weapon is fine too, make sure it's +5 modification.\n\n* Gears\n+ At least 5\/3\/3 sets or mixed 3\/3\/3\/2 level 100 epic sets.\n+ 3\/2\/2\/2 sets is really pushing it, you will have hard time getting in.\n+ Note that this is before any epic reworks so some sets will make you a stronger applicant than others.\n\n* Swap Set\n+ Preferably +10 skill, people don't seem to care much if it's Wrapped set or not.\n+ +9 skill is pushing the line here.\n\n* Enchants\n+ 2nd tier enchants should be plenty.\n+ Decent critical chances, 100% is preferred in dungeon but it's really depends on the class as well.\n+ Weapon: +12-15 elemental damage.\n+ Top\/Bottom: Physical\/Magic\/Independent ATK 45 ~ 50 with or without Strength\/Intelligence +20\n+ Accessory: +25 ~ 30 elemental damage.

As for runes, doesn't really matter that much.\n+ Avatar\/Emblem: Rare set with at least rare emblem that add Strength\/Intelligence.\n+ Insignia: Appropriate one your damage type with rare gems adding at least elemental damage.\n\nFor Synergy Classes* For the most part, these classes has a but of lower cutline but very similar to DPS in term of gears and enchants.\n* Your weapon doesn't really need to be +12, +11 should be okay.\n\nFor Sader\/Buffer Classes* Similar to DPS classes, 5\/3\/3 or 3\/2\/2\/2 set up with appropriate enchants.\n* Seraph\/Enchantress use Int enchants and Male Crusader uses Vit\/Spit enchants.\n* Level 100 epic cross.\n* Pet\/Title: At least 1 of each type that add level to 1A and buff skill.\n\n\n\nRaid Strategy* Note:\n+ Green and Yellow need to come back and clear mirrors as needed so phase 1 doesn't reset.\n+ Green and Yellow continue to clear Castle to give Red and Orange damage buffs.\n\n  \n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 57.14285714285714%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \n\n\nReferencesNamu.wikiPowerPoint -\u00a0Yong\\* (feat.

However, through the Exstream reddit summary, Neople denied this claim.\n* In this post, the author went back to run Stormy Route 401 times (1 extra time by accident) and compare the result to this previous blogpost (collected pre-Sirocco) to see if there are any differences.\n\nProcedure* The author kept the procedure same as the previous post (20 runs on each characters, sells all dropped, no repair cost, etc.).\n* On post-Sirocco data, character 18, the author accidentally ran 21 runs instead of 20 runs.\n* The\u00a0\u00a0column refers to the amount of golds dropped in dungeon plus gold flips at the end plus selling all drops (e.g. common, uncommon, rare, etc.)\n\nThe Data* For this analysis, the author will only show data for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\n\n  \nResult & Discussion* Disclaimer: The author is not a statistician, and the test was performed under the author's best knowledge from an undergraduate stat class. Feel free to suggest a better test.\n* From this website that list all the different tests, and since we're testing the difference between the drops from the same dungeon from 2 separate timeframes to test the nerf hypothesis, the author performed Two-Tailed Unequal Variance Independent T-tests.\n* You can read about how to replicate this test in Excel here.\n* With the P-value of 0.05, the author concludes that there are no differences in\u00a0\u00a0(p>0.05) and\u00a0\u00a0(p>0.05). However, there is a difference in\u00a0\u00a0(p<0.05).\n* The amount different in cumulative golds is about 8.6% (~3,900\u00a0\u00a0per run) comparing the two averages.\n* Worth noting that the definition of \"nerf\" differs between players. The original reddit post was referring to the gold flips at the end of dungeon. Some players claimed that the golds dropped from mobs were actually boosted to compensate for the decrease in gold flip. So since this data was collected under the intention of cumulative gold amounts, it may not reflects the \"nerf\" gold flips nor may it reflects the increase in golds dropped from mobs.\nTL;DR* Do I get less golds from farming Stormy Route?\n+ Statistically speaking: YES\n+ Is it realistically significant? PROBABLY NO\n\n\n\n","479":"\n\n* November 3, 2020 Updates and Events\n* Overview\n+ This update doesn't add any new contents.

The whole process took about 35 mins with this gears. If you have the gear rewards from events, it may take up to an hour of playtime.\n\nStep-By-Step Process\n\n* The 1st Pit, you can clear the whole thing if you want, but at least clear the first few rooms for easy equip drops.\n* This doesn't require any Fatigue Points and give some easy gold selling to NPC.\n* Selling all gives ~67k.\n\n* Basement of Pain & Black Shrine Expert (2+2), these are must clear dungeons as part of DFO daily homework.\n* If lucky, you can some\u00a0, anyway, selling all drops now bring gold to ~145k.\n\n* Stormy Route, great place for gold farm with extra\u00a0\u00a0on the side.\n* Selling all drops EXCEPT for rare items now bring gold to ~870k.\n* Note to leave 8 Fatigue Point at the end.\n* Disaster Sector, great for farming\u00a0, only require 8 Fatigue Point to enter.\n* One clear of Level 3 Disaster Sector gives 27\u00a0.\n* Here you're out of Fatigue Points, now buy one Fatigue Potion on the Auction hall to recover 30 Fatigue Points.\n* Gold at this point down to ~796k.\n\n* Back to Stormy Route then Disaster Sector, 30 Fatigue Points will gives 2 extra Stormy clears and 1 extra Disaster Sector level 3 clear.\n* Total gain of 42\u00a0\u00a0and 54\u00a0.\n* Sold\u00a0\u00a0on Auction Hall at about 8.3k each and sold\u00a0\u00a0to NPC Pumpkin Ball.\n* Gold now up ~1.5 million.\n\n* Extra cash from Rare Items, the author put all rare items collected from Stormy Route on the auction hall, and the next day, 3 out of 5 items were sold, gaining an extra ~119k\n\n  \nResult and Discussion* Of course the drop rate of\u00a0\u00a0along with rare items may varies. Also you can't guarantee to sell all these rare items on the Auction Hall. But at the end of one character farming on a weekend, you can expect to get about 1.5 million gold\u00a0per day.\n* On a weekday, however, since you only have 156 Fatigue Points, you're about 2 Stormies short as compared to playing on weekend. You can expect to get about 1.4 million gold depends on how many\u00a0\u00a0drops on these 2 runs.\nRecommendation\n\n* The entire process took about 35 mins with this full epic gears. If this is one of your character, this process is great for gold farming for those that wants to get some dailies done and don't really have a lot of time playing. 1.5 million a day is about 10 million per week for just casual 35 mins of playing everyday.\n* For those players that don't have this type of gears,\u00a0Don't Ask. Double It!\u00a0gives you great gears to start out. You may be able to clear 2+2 expert but to be honest, 2+2 normal probably won't make much of a different in your gold gain. As for Stormy Route, +12 Epic weapon will give you decent clear time, you may struggle here and there, but with patients and determination, you can still follow this process. It may take you about an hour though. If Stormy Route is too much, Ghent Palace is a great alternative.\n* For those players that only have legendary and no epic weapon, you can still follow this whole process, but instead of Stormy Route, you can do Ghent Palace. Unfortunately, you would get less gold.\n\n\n\n","485":"\n\n* December 1, 2020 Updates and Events\n* Overview\n+ This update doesn't add any new contents.

PoW Talisman Selection) will be changed to have the same stats as the normal version, and modifications will give similar gains to amplification. This is to alleviate the stress of never finding the epic pieces you want to reach endgame.\n* About the new dungeon reward system:\n* We have prepared an item reward that ensures the highest value of the modifier you want, for the option to alleviate RNG.\n* We've considered player opinions and have added the option of changing weapon modifiers to increasing awakening skill levels for all classes to possibly use weapons with these stats.\n* The aim of the epic\/mythic rebalance is to close up the damage gap between sets. We aim to maintain the \"theme\" of each set.\n* In the future when we are developing new gears, we will put this into consideration, to have different \"themed\" gears that dont have major differences in damage.\n* We are working hard to develop the future neo awakenings. In the balance patch starting June, we will, use new skills, changes to skill numbers and changes to how the skills work themselves, to balance and close gaps between the classes.\n* Balance patches will be carried out over periods of time to receive reaction as we go.\n* As we've said, there will be no new characters or subclasses to be released before all the neo awakenings are released. This is our promise to adventurers. The new female slayer subclass is a promise too, but will come afterwards.\n* Ozma will come to KDNF before June 2021.\n* There will be new systems implemented so that in the fight with Ozma, it will strengthen the bond with party members and continuously give feedback to each other. In addition to new monster patterns, please look forward to it.\nReferencesJay's TranslationReddit Translation Part 1  \nReddit Translation Part 2  \nDirector's Note from Discord  \nKDnf Update Page\n\n","498":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2017\/Honey-Time?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","499":"\n\n* This rework was released with the new Female Gunner 3A and Black Purgatory dungeon.\n* Due to the number of Epic available, pieces that did not receive any changes are not included.\n* New <Modification Option> is available for Epic Weapons, Bottom, Ring and Sub-Equipment and can be changed through acquired materials from Black Purgatory dungeons.\n\nModification Option* Each Level 100 Epic Weapon, Bottom, Ring and Sub-Equipment now have brand new option called <Modification Option>.\n* Default <Modification Option> is available at all times, until it was Modified into something else.\n+ 165\u00a0\u00a0obtained from Black Purgatory can be used to reroll the <Modification Option> into a new option and a different value.\n+ 13\u00a0\u00a0also obtained from Black Purgatory can be used to maximize the value of the current <Modification Option>.\n+ After Modifying the <Modification Option> you may choose to keep the current option or swap to the new option.\n+ Modified Equipment cannot be transferred.\n+ Default option for other pieces is varied depending on the equipment and can be raised between as high as +8% from the default value.\n\n* Available Modification Options:\n+ Additional Attack Damage\n+ Additional Critical Damage\n+ Bonus Damage\n+ All Atk.\n+ STR\/INT\n+ Physical\/Magical\/Independent Atk.\n+ Level 50, 85, 100 All Skill +2 (Only available for Weapons) + another damage modifier (4% ~ 16%)\n+ Buffer-only options aside from other damage options\n\n* Changes from test server for weapon:\n+ Default Modification option is set to 14% and can be raised between 18 ~ 30% (excluding +2 Level 50, 85, 100 All Skill option).\n+ Default Modification option specially for World Tree Spirit.png changed from \"Level 50, Level 85, Level 100 Skill Level +2\" to \"Buffer Only Level 50 Skill Level\u00a0+2\"\n\n  \nSelect the Weapon Type or Equip Set to Be Directed to Their ChangesThe Changes Are Highlighted in YellowWeaponSlayer\/KnightFighterGunnerMagePriestThiefLancerAgent  \nArmor  \nAccessory  \nSpecial Equip  \nMixed Set  \nMythic  \nReferencesExcel Sheet -\u00a0Jay's TranslationKDnF Live Server Note  \n  \nChangelog* 1\/8\/20 -\u00a0CHANGED: From test to live server\n+ Weapon\n- <Modification Option> modifier changed from 14% to up to\u00a018% ~ 30%\n- <Modification Option> specially for World Tree Spirit changed from \"Level 50, Level 85, Level 100 Skill Level +2\" to \"Buffer Only Level 50 Skill Level +2\"\n\n+ Solidarity Chain Plate\n+ Fettering Brambles Set\n+ Raido: The Creator of Order\n+ Veteran Soldier's Conquest Set\n+ Crossroad of Choice Set\n\n\n","500":"\n\n* This update adds guide and squad mode for Sirocco raid.\n* More details are located in Neople official website.\n* Events\n+ Honey Weekend\n+ Honey Time\n+ Easy Come, Easy Get\n\n* Sales\n+ Snowman Avatar\n\n* Comments\n+ Honey Weekend\n- The cosmetic are nice.\n- The damage font is from female priest and can't be used until JAN 26.

That's it.\n\n  \n\n\nHow to Upgrade Cards* Upgrading your card will increase its stat and will require other cards with the same rarity as material.\n* For example: in order to upgrade a legendary card, you need to use other legendary cards to upgrade it.\n* You can check how many time a card can be upgraded by looking at the top right corner.\n\n* You can upgrade your card through NPC Abello.\n* Talk to the NPC to open the \"Upgrade Card\" window.\n+ (1) is where you put the card you want to upgrade.\n+ (2) (3) (4) are the material cards needed to upgrade your target card. The more cards you put in these slots, the higher chance your upgrade be successful.\n+ (5) is the stats your card will gain with every upgrade.\n* Yes, upgrade card is also RNG, the more cards you used as material, the higher the chances. As an example below, one card is medium chance (1), two cards is high chance (2), and three cards will guarantee the card upgrade (3).\n  \n\n\nHow to Obtain Cards* The majority of the time, you get end game cards through raids or killing the corresponding monster in dungeon. For example, \"Awakened Wujo Card\" can be dropped by killing \"Awakened Wujo\" in \"Basement of Pain\" dungeon.\n* Beside that, you can get cards through \"Card Binding\" and \"Card Compounding\". Both are very similar. You can check if a card can be obtain through either of these 2 ways by looking at the writing at the bottom.\n+ \"Card Binding Device\" means card binding (duh).\n+ \"Card Crafting\" means card compounding.\n\nCard Binding  \n* Binding cards require binding devices. You can get those through \"Tower of Dazzlement\" dungeon in \"Valley of the Fallen Souls\" and NPC Simona.\n* Then open the device and start throwing your cards in there. The more cards you use, the higher chance you get the next grade card (up to unique grade).\n\n  \nCard Compounding* Very similar to using the binding devices, but here you use NPC Abello.\n* The more cards you use, the higher chances of getting the next grade card (up to unique grade)\n  \n\n\nType of Class and Damage* Your class and damage determine which enchants you should get. There are 5 common types:\n+ Physical Percent Class\n+ Physical Fixed Class\n+ Magical Percent Class\n+ Magical Fixed Class\n+ Buffers\/Saders (e.g. Male Crusader, Seraph, Enchantress)\n\n* For non-sader class, you can tell which group you are by looking at your skills. For example:\n+ (1) indicates the skill is physical damage\n+ (2) indicates the skill is magical damage.\n+ (3) You can see the percent sign indicates percent damage.\n+ (4) You just see the number, no percent sign, indicates fixed damage.\n\n* For your convenience, click this\u00a0Class Stats\u00a0excel sheet to see which one you are.\n\n  \n\n\nWhich Enchant to Use* For non-buffers:\n+ Priority 1: All benefit from critical chances. Priority these enchants before everything else.\n+ Priority 2: All benefit from elemental damages. They trump Physical\/Magical\/Independent Attack.\n+ Lastly, for Percent classes, you get most benefit from \"Physical\/Magic Attack\" and \"Strength\/Intelligent\" enchants, with attack as priority. For Fixed classes, you get most benefit from \"Independent Attack\" and \"Strength\/Intelligent\" enchants, with attack as priority.\n\n* For buffers:\n+ Seraph\/Enchantress: Benefits from Intelligent enchants. Get as much as you can.\n+ Male Crusader: Benefit from Vitality\/Spirit. Either one is fine, he has passive that equalize both stats.\n\n* For your convenience, click each gear slot below to be directed to the list of respected recommended cards\/beads (Non-sader\u00a0only).

The 3 possible options are: Dark Knight, Corrupted Village, and APC Rescue\n\n  \n* The illustration below will give you an idea of how the dungeon progress. The route you take will determine the bosses you face and the reward you get at the end.\n* Here's how the dungeon progresses.\n+ You face Jade (1), then pick your route to the next Crossroad (2).\n+ After fighting the bosses in that route, you face\u00a0Venta (3), then you pick your route to the next Crossroad (4).\n+ Again after fighting there, you fight\u00a0Onyx (5). But before her, you get to rescue an APC that give you a random buff and you also get to meet merchant\u00a0Posha, where you can reset your skill and buy various useful pots.\n+ You then choose your next route (6), fight all the bosses there then meet your final opponent\u00a0Astaros (7).\n* So regardless of which route you take, you get to fight at least 3 mini-bosses (one guarding each Crossroad) and you get to rescue at least 1 APC for a random buff.\n* NOTE: You can retreat without losing dungeon progress. From my understanding, after treating, you start back where you last kill a mini-boss. Keep in mind the more you retreat, the longer you need to wait to go back in. You can use this to your advantages such as resetting skill cooldown before a particular hard boss.\n\n\n\n* Once the APC is rescued, you can use the buff by using the \"Special Dungeon Key\" (defaulted as \"Tab\"). Name of APCs and their buffs below.\n\n* While you're in this route, there's a chance a Dark Knight OR a Follower can intrude. Defeat Dark Knight will increase final reward. Defeat Follower will give permanent damage buff. More details below.\n* Now let's see what you will face if you pick\u00a0Dark Knight and\u00a0Corrupted Village routes.\n\n\n\n* In the image below, each Dark Night (D, Right) is accompanied by a Follower (F, Left), and the pairs are always the same (3 total pairs). You will always fight Follower first, and each successful Dark Knight defeat will grand you more reward at the end.\u00a0 The pairs are:\n+ Drooping Darkness Jet and Timor the Pure Blood.\n+ Despero the Pure Blood and\u00a0Tiamat of Despair.\n+ Blood Drinking Banya and Verias the Doom.\n\n* Note: The location of each pair is randomized.\n\n\n\n  \n* If you pick this route, you will only fight Follower.\n* However, there's a chance his Dark Knight can intrude. If this happen, the\u00a0Dark Knight\u00a0will have less HP, and defeating this\u00a0Dark Knight\u00a0will grant you more rewards as if you were taking the Dark Knight route (yay).\n* The good thing is each Follow defeat will give you damage boost,\u00a03%, 8%, and 25%, respectively.\n\n\n\nPossible Routes* There are endless routes you can take to the final boss depends on your party composition and gears, and you need to weight your risk vs. benefit as well to see how many Dark Knight you want to face.\n* If you look at the rewards, it's divided into stages. So I will go over the route needed to achieve each stage.\nStage 1* Here you don't take any Dark Knight route at all. So your rewards will be minimal. Take this route if your party is extremely barebone.\n* In this route you only face 2 Followers and get to rescue 2 APCs.\n* If your party still really need the damage, you can also pick Corrupted Village route in the beginning (2) to get the 25% boost.\n  \nStage 2* Here you take down 1 Dark Knight.\n* I know the location of Dark Knight pairs are randomized but I'm not sure they would stay the same if you retreat and take another route.\n* So even if they are randomized but stay the same once you know which one they are, potentially you choose which one to take out (4 or 6). For example. if you get into (4) and that boss is too hard, you can take Village at (4) and do Knight at (6) instead, and vice versa.\n* I don't recommend taking Knight at (2) though because you may need that extra APC buff, and since you're only doing 1 Knight, might as well do either (4) or (6).\n  \nStage 3* Here you\u00a0take down 2\u00a0Dark Knight.\n* There's not really any other way. You can try to take Village at (2) if your party need that extra damage buff.\n  \nStage 4* Here you\u00a0take down 3\u00a0Dark Knight\u00a0and all 3 followers.\n* This is definitely the hardest route where you face ALL the bosses and mini-bosses this dungeon has to offer. So proceed with caution.\n\n  \n\n\nBoss Mechanics  \n\n\nTips and Tricks* Rescue APC Paladin Jenna when you can.\n+ After defeating Jade, you will have 3 options to pick which route to go next. Paladin Jenna will always spawn in the APC Rescue route.\n+ You can use her 15-sec groggy ability up to 2 times with 60-sec cooldown in between. So unless you're doing the stage 4, always rescue this APC.\n* Retreat to town with caution.\n+ If you're out of coin, you can always retreat to town and retry. Retreat will reset all your skills so you can use this as your advantage. However, retreat doesn't reset your 5 coin limit.\n+ However, be careful, the more you reset, the longer you have to wait to go back in (5 seconds, 80 seconds, 100 seconds, 130 seconds, 180 seconds, and so on). So I don't really recommend you retreat more than 2 times.\n\n* Know when to dump all your skills.\n+ First, the merchant\u00a0Posha can reset all your skills for just 1 time (left circle). So you can dump all your skill on the boss before him.\n+ Second, this go in hand with retreating, dump all your skill before the final boss (right circle). After that, you can retreat to reset skills then go back to fight the final boss. Since the first retreat only have 5-sec downtime, most parties use this strategy.\n* Know when to Sader 1A\/3A.\n+ NOTE: This content is focused on sustain damage, so sader should bind 1A to 3A. There you can cast 1A while 3A is on cooldown, and vice versa.\n+ For Stage 1-3, the recommend spots are below. Really self explanatory, here you combine both merchant Posha\u00a0and town retreat to reset your 1A\/3A.\n\n+ For Stage 4, since this is the hardest difficulty, you may have to retreat twice (once after 1st dark knight, then once right before final boss).\n  \n  \n\n\nRewardsFinal boss has chance to drop\u00a0Random Epic\/Mythic\/Product of Corruption\u00a0  \n\n\nPossible Monster Cards  \n\n\nReferencesKDnF Official Patch Note  \nReddit -\u00a0Merry's Guide  \nblog.naver.com  \nNamu.wiki  \nChangelog* July 13, 2021 - Clarified that retreat doesn't reset the 5 coin limit\n* July 12, 2021 - Added \"Tips and Tricks\" and reorganized 1A\/3A\n* July 8, 2021 - Added when to 1A\/3A\n\n\n","506":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2047\/Abellos-Gift?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","507":"\n\n* DFO is a great multiplayer beat 'em up action role-playing game. This game definitely reminds you of the 90s fighting game.\n* You're in luck because this game does have internal support for controllers. Unfortunately this internal program is not that great. You can move around, but you can't map the skills.\n* This article outlines step-by-step process of using an external program called Xpadder so you can play with any controller (XBox One as example).\n* Disclaimer: I know plenty of players in DFOG server that use external program to map out controller that have been playing for years and don't get banned. However, there are some people also claimed they get banned for it. Do your own research and use this guide at your own risk.\n\nTable of Contents* Purchase Xpadder\n* Before Getting Started\n* How to Set-up\n* Assign Your Keys\n* Tips & Tricks\n* Example\n\n\n\nPurchase Xpadder* You can download through this link\u00a0xpadder.com. The link looks sketchy but this is where I got it from. It costs $9.99 as one time payment.\n* Once entered in you will get email of how to buy with PayPal, then you get access to many other info such as forum, controller images, preset profile, etc.\n  \n\n\nBefore Getting Started* Make sure you connect your controller AFTER logging into DFO. The reason for this is that you don't want DFO client to recognize the controller and using its internal integration. We're trying to use a 3rd party program here.\n* Also make sure you run the program \"As Administrator\", and set up \"Compatibility Mode\" using instruction below.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nHow to Set-up* Once installed, open the program a make a new profile.\n* Then use the following steps to register the controller's keys.\n* A disadvantage of Xpadder is that it doesn't register special key such as \"Home\" key with Xbox One.\n* Once added your controller image (Xbox One as example) and register your keys, move them around to match your image.\n\n  \n\n\nAssign Your Keys* To assign a key, click on the key you want (1), then select what you want that key to do (2)\n* That's pretty much. Map all your keys and have fun playing DFO.\n\n\nTips & Tricks* Your default left and right thumbsticks only register 4 keys each, but you can change it so that it can do 8 keys each.\n* Note that you can adjust the sensitivity of the thumbsticks so it can give you less room of error and not accidentally casting the wrong skill.\n\n* We also know that DFO has lot of keys so it can be hard to register everything on one profile.\n* Luckily, Xpadder gives you option to switch between profiles so you can assign a set of keys on one profile and another set of keys on another profile.\n* Example swapping profile 7 and 8\n+ Click on a key (1), then \"Advanced\" (2)\n+ Pick \"Set Selector\" (3), then \"Set 8 Two-way\" (4) (two-way means each key stroke will send you between profiles)\n\n  \n\n\nExample* On the daily basis, I play DFO with 2 profiles. You can see some gameplay examples from my YouTube channel.\n* Profile 1 is where I register all basic keys such as movement arrows, skill quick slots \"QWERTV\" and \"ASDFGH\".\n* I also have quick slots \"123\" as potions and \"9\" as \"\/\/setitem\" for quick dungeon drops pick up.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Profile 1 |\n\n* Profile 2 is any other special keys that doesn't fit in profile 1.\n* Here I have \"F10, F11, F12\" for quick \"Dungeon Restart, Select Other Dungeon, Back to Town\" options, along with quick slot \"456\" as things like \"Faithful Owl\" and \"Ria's Communicator\".\n* I also have the \"right thumbstrick\" as mouse control and \"left\/right trigger\" as left\/right mouse click so I can sit on the couch and not have to reach for the mouse for some simple mouse clicking and changing characters.\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Profile 2 |\n\n\n\n","508":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2046\/Ancient-Dungeon-Adventure-Time?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","509":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2045\/Cleansing-of-the-Cursed-Cross?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","510":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2035\/New-Year-Tarot-Spread?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","511":"\n  \n  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2070\/DFO-Content-Creator-Season-2?page=3  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/community\/contentcreators\n\n\n\n","512":"\n\n* Coefficient tablets are charts made by KDnF community.\n* In a nutshell, it gives every class the same gears, then rank the damage of every skill and talisman corresponding to each class.

Of course basic math here, bigger ratio means higher numerator (aka damage) and lower denominator (cooldown).\n+ As you can see, when deciding skills, you really need to combine all 3 columns AND your knowledge of how each skill works.\n\n* Example of how I would use this table:\n+ May rank very high on the chart. However, the damage\/cooldown ratio is relatively low, plus the skill has long animation. Thus not many players, including myself, max this skill.\n+ May rank very low on the chart. However, the damage\/cooldown ratio is relatively higher than other skills. Thus many players max these as sustain damage skills.\n+ Itself already a decent damage skill with great damage\/cooldown ratio. With its talisman, even though the damage ranking is not the highest, its damage\/cooldown ratio is very high. Therefore with both combination, this skill and talisman combination is a must.\nHow It's Calculated* To be honest, I'm not really sure how they come up with these number.\n* From the reference below, I know that these are the gear used, and they tested in Training Room using Meteor as the 25-second target.

Both have special rewards through card flip at at the end for the first 2 runs. So 250 total 2+2 runs is 1,000 dungeon clears.\n* The procedure was very simple, I ran 2+2 on multiple alts and record their\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drops. I didn't record any gold drops or gold from selling equipment. I also bought all from Gabriel and didn't pick any purple special reward cards.\n* In the data below, for the sake of data presentation, each group is a combined result of 25 data points, and each data point is the result of 2 Black Shrine and 2 Basement of Pain runs. For complete information of all data points, you can visit this\u00a0PDF file.\n* The \"Total Raw Gold\" is the price of all tradable stuffs (e.g.\u00a0). Prices used:\u00a048,500\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a07,397\u00a0.\n\n  \nDiscussion* How much progression can you get from doing 2+2?\n+ With level 100 cap, progression is quite simple actually. Since you can upgrade level 95 Fiend War and Prey slots in to level 100 epics, you really only need 4 good epic pieces to drop, 5 if you include weapon.\n+ Take my Female Spitfire for example, with her 4 drops, I can continue farming 2+2 for\u00a0, then upgrade 3 pieces Mother Nature, 3 pieces Normal Syncho, and then ditto the last piece through Oculus dungeon. As for weapon, you can do pit 456 for RNG weapon pot, or if you really desperate, transfer the weapon if it drop from other alts.\n+ Neople has been giving out\u00a0\u00a0and discount recipes through events, with just a couple months of farming, you can upgrade your equipment easily.\n+ Now can this strategy get you into Sirocco Red party? NO. But with optimization, you definitely have a chance for Green party.\n\n* What's the expected drop rate?\n+ As you can see from the data, after 1,000 runs, I got 89 drops. So it's about 9% drop rate.\n+ Note that this is a combination of both gold flip and drop from killing the boss though. I can tell you that the drop from killing boss is even lower, I didn't keep track, but I can definitely count it on two hands. So the drop rate probably around 8.5-9%.\n+ So if you're lucky, maybe you can get that good 4 pieces and 1 usable weapon. Most of my weapon drops from\u00a0Top 12 Progression\u00a0page is from these 2 dungeons.\n\n* Should you continue to farm 2+2 with characters that already 12\/12?\n+ Yes, definitely yes,\u00a0\u00a0can be converted into\u00a0\u00a0if you need to transfer that last epic piece.\n+ Each epic transfer requires 125\u00a0, which is 12,500\u00a0\u00a0(aka 12,500\u00a0). If you're new here,\u00a0\u00a0is not your bottleneck. Farming 126\u00a0\u00a0for a weapon or 168\u00a0\u00a0for a equipment is not that hard. It's getting 125\u00a0\u00a0is the hard part.\n+ Therefore, keep farming these\u00a0\u00a0so you can eventually funnel to gear up other characters. As a bonus, you get about 2 million gold for every 25 daily 2+2 runs, and that is not including the white drops you can sell to NPC. Gearing up alts, and cash on the side, 2 birds with 1 stone.\n\n\n","514":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2069\/Lovey-Dovey-Tobys-Gift?page=3  \n\n\n\n\n","515":"\n\n* Test server note was released on January 27, 2021.\n* Live server note was released on February 2, 2021.\n* It adds knight's 3rd awakening along with 10 floors expansion to Cursed Ruby dungeon and new area for Arad Adventure system.\n\nTable of Contents* Knight 3rd Awakening\n+ Elven Knight\n+ Chaos\n+ Paladin\n+ Dragon Knight\n+ Idle Animation\n+ Official Trailers & Artworks\n\n* Cursed Ruby Expansion\n+ Hidden Dungeon\n+ New Reward Chest\n\n* Arad Adventure Subjugation\n+ New Subjugation Reward\n\n* References\n\n\nKnight 3rd Awakening\n\nElven Knight* Straight Damage Increases\n+ +23%,\u00a0+22.6%,\u00a0+20.8%,\u00a0+23%,\u00a0+23.3,\u00a0+20.1%,\u00a0+23.7%,\u00a0+23.1%\n\n* Other Skill Changes\n+ Overwhelm: Attack +22%.

After 7 months of data, I finally hit my 1,000th ebin.\n* Are you wondering what they're consist of? This post will show you.\n* All raw data is located in this\u00a0PDF file.\n\nTop Duplicates* Of course my #1 drop is a weapon, and one of them is an Agent's weapon.\n* Top duplicate are:\n\n  \nTop Locations* To be honest, I didn't really do Guide of Wisdom that much. Rarely did I remember doing full 156fp bar.\n* As you can see, Basement of Pain and Black Shrine counts are very similar (33.8% vs. 32.6%).\n* A very small portion drop is from Land of Memories and Bottomless Tunnel. I did get quite a bit of drops from the event dungeon though.\n* As for Oculus, I only do on the character that I need. When I got the Ditto, I was slacking on doing the dungeon on the weekly basis.\n\n  \nTop Character Drops* It's ironic that my main Male Ranger is actually not the top character getting the drops.\n* Apparently Male Spitfire leads the chart with 114 drops, followed by Female Nen with 113 drops.\n* Most of these drops are from doing daily 2+2, you can follow their gearing path in details through this\u00a0Top 12 Progression\u00a0page.\n  \nTop Slots* No shocker here, Weapon is the #1 with 364 drops, and yes, Agent weapon  is one of the top drops.\n* If you think about the distribution of level 100 epic, this chart reflects it pretty closely.\n* There are 19 tops, bottoms and shoes; 15 belts and shoulders; 8 bracelets, necklaces, rings, sub, stone and earrings. lastly there are 74 weapons.\n* However you can't find ele, syncro or mother so we takes those out and that leaves us with 18 tops, bottoms, and shoes, 14 belts and shoulders, 7 bracelets, necklaces, rings, sub, stone and earrings. for a total of 198 epics.\n* This would put tops, bottoms and shoes at 9% drop rate; belts and shoulders at 7% drop rate; the entire right side at 3.53% drop rate; lastly weapons would be 37.37%\n* Looking at pie chart, it's VERY close, well within error.\n\n  \nMythic Drops* Lastly, How many Mythic?\n* You can't see it on the chart due to small numbers. I got 20 Product of Wisdoms and 3 Mythics. I only got 2% PoW, but it makes sense because I didn't really do Guide of Wisdom that much. Since PoW doesn't drop in 2+2. This number would definitely higher the more you run Guide of Wisdom.\n* Only 3 Mythic out of 1,000 drops. Looks like my RNG is not that good.\n  \nChangelog* 2\/24\/21\n+ ADDED: Clarification in \"Top Slots\" and \"Mythic Drops\"\n+ Thanks to the great feedbacks from a viewer who wished to remain anonymous.\n\n\n","518":"\n\n* With Exile Mountains update, expansion to the talisman system is added, and I'm sure lot of players will be asking which one they should use.\n* Wondering which talisman is better? This article outlines my recommendation that you should consider when picking your next talisman.\nWhich Talisman Should I Use?* Back when we only have 5 talismans, we have a KDnF popularity list to guide us on which talisman should you use.\n* Now with this expansion, we don't have any guideline from Korea on which we should use. So here is my advice and recommendation you should consider when picking your next talisman.\n* In a nutshell, Talisman system intention is to provide players variety of ways to customize their skills. At the bottom line, look at it in 2 angles, damage advantage and structure advantage. Damage and cooldown usually go hand-in-hand, so really 3 things.\n* And of course, considering these things will require you to READ and use your brain,\u00a0I know it's hard, DFOG players can't read \\*insert meme here\\*\n\nDamage Advantage* What you need is to learn how to read damage chart. It basically takes all talisman's damage and their cooldown and rank them. Here're\u00a0Coefficient Archive\u00a0(aka damage charts) and\u00a0Simple Guide to Damage Coefficient Table\u00a0(aka how to read these tables).\n* Note that just because a talisman is top damage, doesn't mean you should pick it. You need to take cooldown into consideration. \"Damage\/cooldown ratio\" is where I would pay close attention to, especially newer contents tend to head toward sustain damage (e.g. Exiles and Black Purgatory).\n\nStructure Advantage  \n* Ask yourself, does this talisman make sense to use? does its skill augmentation worth it?\n* Personally, what I looks for is if a talisman allows me to cast the skill easier and if I can cancel it out to another skill. Those quality-of-life rank higher for me.\n\nExample* Male ranger is my main, so I'll show you my thought process of choosing this 3rd talisman slot.\n* Below is the damage table for his talisman, we have skill name (1st column), its damage (2nd column), and damage\/cooldown ratio (3rd column).\n* The 2 new talisman are Fast Draw\u00a0\u00a0and Wipe Out\u00a0, now think about your \"Damage Advantage\", we clearly see the winner (Fast Draw) due to higher overall damage. Not only that, the damage\/cooldown ratio is better as well.\n* How about \"Structure Advantage\"? Below is what the skills look like. Fast Draw\u00a0\u00a0allows you shoot faster (aka reduce cast time), which can be a huge advantage since you can fit more skills in between Death Hawk\u00a0.\n\n* For Wipe Out\u00a0,\u00a0instead of casting the skill at a distance, you now cast it right where you are.\n* For me, it's not really an advantage because male ranger doesn't really cast that many skills while he's right on the target except for Wild Shot\u00a0\u00a0and Deadly Approach\u00a0\u00a0really. Beside that, Male ranger usually do damage standing in front of the target, not right on it. So for me, it doesn't really make sense to use Wipe Out talisman.\n\n* In conclusion, looking at damage\/cooldown ratios and structural advantages of both talismans, I'll be using Fast Draw\u00a0.\n\nReferencesExcel -\u00a0KDnF 75\/80 Talismans  \n\n\n","519":"\n\n* This review is only for the talisman version from Pandemonium War dungeon.\n* This article outlines pros and cons of Male Ranger 5 talismans and recommendation of which one should you use.\n\nTable of Contents* 1.

Description\n+ Always max speed and max hit count.\n- Min hit count increased to match max hit count.\n- Multi-attack removed.\n- Atk. +14%\n- Attack Speed +50%\n\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- Shot count +10%\n- Wild Shot attack range +20%\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage With Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n* 1.2. Advantages\n+ Structure change: The main point of this talisman is to always fire the bullets at max speed without scarifying any damage. Originally you need to continuously hit the \"attack\" button to increase firing speed.\n+ Damage: Great damage increase (+29.7% from my testing). Based on the coefficient table, this skill is not the top in term of raw damage increase. However, the damage\/cooldown ratio is amazing. With 25-sec rotation in sirocco, you can definitely fit 2\u00a0.\n\n\n\n* 1.3. Disadvantages\n+ There's none really. This talisman fires so fast that you don't need to worry about missing any shot even if the boss move around a lot.\n\n* 1.4. Overall Review\n+ Great structural improvement to the skill plus damage increase with pretty much no penalty.\n+ This talisman is a MUST-have.\n\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n2. Level 40 Skill - Multi Headshot\u00a0\u00a0(Wide Out\u00a0)\n\n* 2.1. Description\n+ Scans and attack all enemies in front when cast.\n- Changes to a single-hit attack.\n- Basic Atk. +480%\n\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- Attack\/detection range +30%\n- Targeting speed -30% in case of multi-attack\n- Additional Basic Atk. +30%\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage With Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n* 2.2. Advantages\n+ Structure change: Originally, you need to tap the arrow keys 5 times to fire all the shot. The main point of this talisman is to combine all to just 1 shot. It also scan all the area around you and hit every target in those area. Personally it's a great quality-of-life improvement to the skill, but at the same time, I'm not butt hurt if I need to press the same key 5 times.\n+ Cast time: Both with or without talisman, you're immobilized for a very similar amount of time. Although if you can hit the key fast enough, this talisman could be a no-no for you.\n\n* 2.3. Disadvantages\n+ Damage: The increase is not that great (+21.8% from my testing). Again with the ecoefficiency table, the damage increase and damage\/cooldown ratio are both worst than\u00a0.\n\n  \n\n\n* 2.4. Overall Review\n+ This talisman offers great structural improvement to the skill. You now don't even need to press the skill multiple times. Which I can see as selling point for some players.\n+ But at the same time, the damage increase is not great. There are other better talismans out there, thus I can't recommend this talisman for regular usage.\n+ Thus, OKAY to use if you don't have other better talisman\n\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n  \n\n\n3. Level 45 Skill - Death Hawk\u00a0\u00a0(Double Grinder\u00a0)\n\n* 3.1. Description\n+ Throwing count -1\n- Starts throwing the Hawk after its first return.\n- 1st and 2nd attack multi-hit interval -30%\n- 1st attack Atk. +8%\n\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- Hawk size +40%\n- Hawk interval +100%\n- Catching the Hawk doesn't push you backward.\n\n+ Firing skills can be used to auto re-throw the Hawk.\n- Consumes 1\u00a0Stylish\u00a0\u00a0stack.\n- Headshot,\u00a0\u00a0Wild Shot,\u00a0\u00a0Multi Headshot,\u00a0\u00a0Suppressive Barrage,\u00a0\u00a0Fast Draw, and\u00a0\u00a0Wipeout\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Damage With Talisman |\n\n\n\n* 3.2. Advantages\n+ Structure change: This talisman in a nutshell decrease the cast time of the skill in a specific way. You lose 1 hawk throw, but in return, the throw spin longer, bigger, and more multi-hit. This is very important because the bread-and-butter of male ranger is not just Death Hawk, it's the skills you cast in between the throw that gives him damage and make him unique.\n+ Without talisman, it's close to impossible to cast more than 1 big skill in between throw because the spin interval is way too short. In the example below, I couldn't fit\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0in between the spin.\n\n\u00a0+ With talisman, due to the longer spin time, even through you're losing 1 throw, you can cast more than 1 big skills in between throw, thus making him more viable. In the example below, I can cast\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0with the 1st throw, and\u00a0\u00a0with the 2nd throw. This extra time definitely gives you more opportunity to play around with for all your rotation practice.\n\n+ Damage: In term of coefficient table, this talisman is top of the chart, AND it's damage\/cooldown ratio is amazing as well.\n\n\n\n* 3.3. Disadvantages\n+ None really, this talisman is so good, pretty much everyone uses it.\n\n* 3.4. Overall Review\n+ This talisman offers great structural changes to the skill and is a complete game changer for male ranger. Even though it takes away 1 spin, but in return, you get higher damage and the spin last longer so you can fit more skills in between.\n+ On the plus side, its damage and cooldown ratio is on the top of the damage chart among all male ranger talisman.\n+ This talisman is a MUST-have.\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n4. Level 60 Skill - Deadly Approach\u00a0\u00a0(Prey Hunt\u00a0)\n\n* 4.1. Description\n+ Auto-casts\u00a0\u00a0Western Fire upon landing.\n- Auto Western Fire Atk.: 17% of overall Deadly Approach Atk.\n- Does not consume\u00a0\u00a0stacks when cancel-used.\n- Can't be used at 0\u00a0\u00a0stacks.\n\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- The auto Western Fire replenishes 1\u00a0\u00a0stack on hit.\n- Additional Auto Western Fire Atk. +5%\n- Cooldown -10%\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n\n\n* 4.2. Advantages\n+ Structure change: The only thing this talisman has to offer is the extra\u00a0. Note that this does NOT share cooldown with the actual\u00a0\u00a0skill. So technically you can cast\u00a0\u00a0(with\u00a0\u00a0as bonus), then\u00a0, then\u00a0\u00a0again)\n\n\n\n* 4.3. Disadvantages\n+ Damage: It offers a small cooldown to the skill but absolutely does nothing to the skill\u00a0\u00a0itself. All you're getting is an extra\u00a0. Its damage\/cooldown ratio is not great either.\n\n\n\n* 4.4. Overall Review\n+ This talisman really doesn't do anything to the skill itself. It only add an extra\u00a0. In a way, it automatically re-direct yourself so you face the target as you land (if you can call that an advantage).\n+ Beside that, there's nothing great about this talisman.\n+ Highly NOT recommended.\n\n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n5. Level 70 Skill - Suppressive Barrage\u00a0\u00a0(Magazine Handling\u00a0)\n\n* 5.1. Description\n+ Firing duration +0.3 sec.\n+ Talisman Additional Effects\n- Finishing Atk. +52%\n- Attack Speed +20%\n- Attack range +30%\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Without Talisman |\n\n  \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| With Talisman |\n\n\n\n* 5.2. Advantages\n+ Damage: Coefficiently speaking, it's the 2nd best in damage. Here you also have higher range and higher attack speed.\n\n\n\n* 5.3. Disadvantages\n+ Cooldown: Damage\/cooldown ratio is really at the bottom of the list. The skill itself already has a 50 seconds cooldown, lots of male ranger players don't max this skill (I do personally). Even though the damage increase is high, its cooldown is the main downfall.\n+ Skill duration: The description said only increase of 0.3 second. But when I tested the skill, it seems to increase much more significantly (look at the gif comparison above).\n\n* 5.4. Overall Review\n+ From a technical point of view, the skill cooldown already way too long to put SP on. And adding the terrible damage\/cooldown ratio, this talisman is really the bottom of the list.\n+ Highly\u00a0NOT\u00a0recommended.\n\n  \n--------------------\u20df--------------------  \n\n\n6. Overall Recommendations* Since you only have 2 slots, I highly recommend Death Hawk and Wild Shot.\n  \nReferencesSkill Icon -\u00a0DFO Wiki  \nCoefficient Archive  \n\n\n","520":"\n  \n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2076\/Dungeon-Miner-Online?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","521":"\n  \n\u00a0https:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2077\/Honey-Time?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","522":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2078\/Master-of-The-Exile-Mountains?page=2  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/notices\/2171\/Master-of-The-Exile-Mountains-Winner-Announcement?page=1&srch=title.master\n\n\n\n","523":"\n\n* Undaunted Determination is a great way to funnel your characters.\n* Ever wonder why many veterans cap them weekly? This article outlines this process in details along with my example.\n\nTable of Contents* What is Undaunted Determination?\n* What is it Used For?\n* How to Cap Weekly Limit\n+ Top Tier: Many Sirocco Ready\n+ Mid Tier: Prey Over-Geared But Not Enough For Sirocco\n+ Low Tier: Only Legendary Gears\n\n* How I Do It\n\n\n\nWhat is Undaunted Determination?\n\n* It is a universal reward for clearing raids (e.g. Fiend War, Prey, Sirocco). You can get up 4,000\u00a0\u00a0per week.\n* You will get different amount of\u00a0\u00a0based on the type of mode you do.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is it Used For?* is primarily used to buy epic soul boxes from the raid shop and RNG reward from \"Raid Special List\".\n* You can access the raid shop though the main DFO menu.\n  \n* Through NPC Magar, you then can trade each\u00a0\u00a0for 20\u00a0, which you can use to run Guide of Wisdom to roll your RNG for level 100 epics.\n* As you can see, this is a great way to funnel your resources into a character you want to gear up.\n\n  \n\n\nHow to Cap Weekly Limit* Unfortunately, each character can only get 650\u00a0, so you will need at least 7 characters to cap this weekly limit.\n* Another thing, due to weekly raid entry limit (2 per raid per character), you will\u00a0need to do more than 1 type of raid. For example, doing only Sirocco on 7 characters will only give you 2,800\u00a0\u00a0so that's not enough.\n* So how much raid do you need to do? I'll break it down based on the type of player using the least amount of effort.\n\n\n\nTop Tier: Many Sirocco Ready* If you can do Sirocco, you can do Prey raid.\n* Using 7 characters, you only need to 14 Preys and 6 Siroccos.\n* With 7 Sirocco ready characters, you can enter easy 4-man Prey party, if you can find a group to people to do your Prey train, you can knock it out easily and quickly.\n\n\n\nMid Tier: Prey Over-Geared But Not Enough For Sirocco  \n* These are the type of characters that are strong enough to enter 8-man prey party. Usually a mix of level 100 legendary and epic sets.\n* Of course, if you can do Prey, you can do Fiend War, using 7 characters, you need 14 Preys and 10 Fiend Wars. Technically 8 Fiend Wars are enough to cap, but since you cap at 650\u00a0\u00a0per character, you will need the 2 extra Fiend Wars.\n* Since Fiend War is a lot easier, you could potentially do 14 Fiend Wars and 11 Preys instead. Again due to cap 650 per character, you will need that extra Prey.\n\n\n\nLow Tier: Only Legendary Gears  \n  \n* Technically speaking, having full level 100 legendary gear should be enough to do Prey raid. However, with pub raid nowadays, you will have hard time getting into 8-man party, let alone 4-man party, and 12-man party is very rare.\n* So potentially, unless you want to wait a long time for a 12-man prey party, you can only do Fiend War here. And you will need more than 7 characters, 14 to be exact (aka 27 Fiend Wars).\n* In the other hand, asking a new player to make and play 14 characters is extremely UNREALISTIC. So my advice is if this is you, don't worry about this process yet.\n\n\n\nHow I Do It* You can look at my\u00a0Top 12 Progression\u00a0and judge for yourself.\n* For me, Sirocco pub raids take way too long to fill up. So I only do it on 1 character. Therefore most of my raiding to cap this is from Preys and Fiend Wars.\n* On the weeks that I'm busy on the weekend, I do about 13-14 Fiend Wars on Wednesday, about 8-9 Preys on Thursday, 1 Sirocco each on Friday and Saturday.\n* On the weeks that I'm free on the weekend, I do about 10-11 Preys on Thursday, 1 Sirocco each on Friday and Saturday, then 7-8 Preys on Saturday.\n\n\n","524":"\n\n\n\n\n\nChantri Town\nchantri.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

Your Fiend War and Prey gears can now be upgraded to level 100.\n* This article outlines in detail this upgrading process and is meant for new or returning players.\n\nTable of Contents* Required Materials\n* What Gears Can Be Upgraded?\n+ Left Side (Fiend War raid)\n+ Right Side (Prey raid)\n\n\nRequired Materials for Upgrading* In the nutshell, NPC Dorothy is the one doing the upgrade for you. She can be found in Chest Town in Dark Side region (image below)\n\n* In the example below, all you need to do is drag the item into the window. Each upgrade requires 1,850 Black Crystals\u00a0\u00a0and 50 Aiolites\u00a0. You get to keep your enchantment \/ reinforcement \/ amplification this way.\n* Depends on the reinforcement and amplification of the original piece, you may need to provide some Engraving Stones\n\n* Black Crystals are reward materials from Black Shrine and Basement of Pain dungeon, located in Roschest. You can get the rewards twice per dungeon per character per day.\n* Aiolites can drops from these 2 dungeons and all other level 100 dungeons.\n\n* Engraving Stone can be trade in through NPC like Loton.\n* can be traded for by 1 Wisdom Crystal , which can be traded for by 100 Wisdom Crystal Fragment\u00a0.\n* are drops from Guide of Wisdom dungeon and can be also be traded\u00a0from .\n\n  \n\n\nWhat Gears Can Be Upgraded?* The only gears allowed to upgrade through this path are Super Tayberr armors (Left Side) and Prey Accessory\/Special Equip pieces (Right Side).\n* Unfortunately, you can't upgrade your level 95 weapon.\n  \n\n\nLeft Side* Regardless of the Super Tayberr type, they will all be upgraded to \"Mother Nature's Breath Set\"\n* This set is not top tier but it's pretty good for a straight forward upgrade.\n* Super Tayberr can be upgraded from Regular Tayberr set, which can be bought through NPC Joshua in Pandemonium Junction using Sky Fragment\u00a0. You can get\u00a0\u00a0from Tayberr dungeon, Pandemonium Meeting, 1st Pit & 2nd Pit.\n* In order to upgrade your Tayberr armor, talk to NPC Masked Knight in Elvenguard.\n* Upgrading each piece will require 75\u00a0\u00a0and some other materials. On average, you can expect to upgrade each piece every about 2 weeks worth of raids.\n\n* That's a lot of walking, so there's a way you can skip all of that and just buy the recipe from the Raid shop.\n* Using this you get to skip the buying Regular Tayberr part, the downside is it requires 96\u00a0\u00a0instead of 75, you still need 20\u00a0\u00a0though.\u00a0So it's up to you which way you want to get there.\n\n* If you want to skip that 20\u00a0\u00a0too, you can use the \"Antimatter Dynamo Box\" from the Mileage shop.\n\n  \n\n\nRight Side* Regardless of which set you pick, they will all upgrade to the same level 100 sets.\n* Accessory will upgrade to \"Elementalist's Accessory Set\". This set is not as great for DPS\/syn classes, however with the epic rework, it got a small boost.\n* Special Equipment will upgrade to \"Normalizing Synchro Set\". Similar to left side, this set is great for a straight forward upgrade.\n* Very similar to upgrading Left Side, you get Prey Equipment from upgrading Regular Tayberr pieces (bought from the same NPC Joshua).\n* You can upgrade by using \"Chest of Power\" in \"Ashen Grave\". It will require 140\u00a0\u00a0and similar materials. Unlike Fiend War, each piece will take about 1 month worth of Prey raids.\n\n* Again, same as upgrading Left Side, you can buy the recipe from raid shop or mileage shop to reduce material costs. You gonna need 190\u00a0\u00a0instead of 140 though.\n\n\n\n","526":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2103\/Cloaks-and-Daggers?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","527":"\n  \n  \n\u00a0https:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2100\/4-Weeks-of-Bliss?page=2\n\n\n\n","528":"\n  \n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2101\/Altimate-Power-Leveling-20?page=2  \n\n\n\n\n","529":"\n\n* Ever wonder how much effort is needed to make that weekly transfer? Wouldn't it be nice to be 12\/12 in 3 months?\n* Assuming you only have 156fp per alt, this article will show you how many characters you need to play.\n* Too much reading? \ud83d\udc49 TL;DR\u00a0\ud83d\udc48\n\nRequired Materials* The mats for weapon is a bit cheaper, but here I'll do the math for other slots.\n* In a nutshell, 2 notable materials are 168 Epic Souls\u00a0\u00a0and 125 Wisdom Crystal\u00a0.\n\nEpic Souls* How in the world can you get 168\u00a0\u00a0in a week?\n* Your 1st main source is from raid, capping weekly\u00a0Undaunted Determination\u00a0\u00a0will get you 40\u00a0. You can read more about it in this\u00a0How to Cap Weekly Undaunted Determination\u00a0post.\n* 2nd main source is Dawning Crevice (DC), I only started collecting data for only 200 runs, so far, you can expect to get at least 8\u00a0\u00a0per 50 dungeon clears (aka 25 characters), assuming you have the worst luck and not having any epic drops. I have details how to convert these materials into epic souls in my\u00a0Gold Farming\u00a0guide. Think of it this way, for every character you do DC on, that's enough mats for about 0.32\u00a0.\n\n* So to get the remaining 128\u00a0\u00a0in 7 days, you will need to do daily DC on at least 57 alts to get enough mats.\n* The 3rd way for this to farm gold and buy Product of Wisdoms (PoW) then dissemble them. If farming DC on 57 alts is not enough work for you, the more stormy you farm, the more PoW you can buy and grind for more souls.\n+ 156fp will only get you 19 stormy runs, and let's say you do your daily 2+2 and 2 DC runs, that'll leave you with 13 stormy runs per character.\n+ Looking at my\u00a0Stormy Route: Sirocco \"Nerf\" Debunked\u00a0data, 13 runs will get you roughly 775k. With PoW price about 1 million gold each, you can expect to get about 3\/4\u00a0\u00a0per character.\n+ If you add the average soul gain from DC to this method (0.32+ 0.75), you can expect to get about 1\u00a0\u00a0per character (aka, do 2+2, then 2 DCs, then spent rest of fp on stormy, then sell all drop and\u00a0).\n+ So if you're following this path instead, you can get 128\u00a0\u00a0by doing about 18.3 alts per day. (Pick your poison, 18 alts on 2+2 DC stormy daily or 57 alts on just DC daily).\n\nWisdom Crystal* 125 Wisdom Crystal\u00a0\u00a0is 12,500\u00a0Wisdom Crystal Fragment\u00a0, which is about 1,785 needed per day.\n* There're 4 main dungeon sources of\u00a0:\u00a0Guide of Wisdom, Basement of Pain, Black Shrine, and Oculus. Beside Guide of Wisdom, the other 3 dungeons give\u00a0, which can be converted into\u00a0\u00a0at 1:1 ratio from NPC Loton.\n* Looking at my\u00a0Black Shrine and Basement of Pain: Result of 1,000 Dungeon Runs\u00a0data, you get about 61\u00a0\u00a0per day, doing that 7 days a week and add reward from your 2 weekly Oculus runs (46\u00a0\u00a0each run), you get about 518\u00a0\u00a0per week per character.\n* So 125\u00a0\u00a0will require you to do daily 2+2 and weekly Oculus on about 24 characters. Assuming you don't do any Guide of Wisdom at all. That calculation doesn't include the 60fp needed for weekly Oculus runs per character, so you're looking at even more stormy farming.\n\n\nTL;DR* To transfer 1 non-weapon level 100 epic per week, you will roughly need:\n+ For\u00a0: Cap 4,000\u00a0\u00a0through raids. Then full 156fp burn on 18 alts daily or DC on 57 alts daily.\n+ For\u00a0: Do daily 2+2 and weekly Oculus on 24 alts.\n\n* As you can see, the\u00a0\u00a0is really the bottleneck in this process. Not many people do Oculus on 24 alts, let along waiting on pub parties to fill up.\n\n\n","530":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/pg\/Fanart-Contest-6th-Anniversary  \n\n\n\n\n","531":"\n\n* Test server note was released on March 24th, 2021.\n* Live server note was released on March 31th, 2021.\n* This patch adds Black Purgatory Guide & Squad mode, along with changes with Sirocco rewards QoL and Cursed Ruby.\n\nBlack Purgatory New Modes* Will cost 30fp to enter and will require\u00a05938 exorcism.\n* They both share same entries as normal mode and similar entry (once per day, thrice weekly, twice weekly reward).

When you enter the dungeon, you're basically fighting waves of enemies. The more waves you can survive, the more reward coins you get at the end. You will fight a boss every 10th wave.\n* In the top right corner, you will see a count down, you don't have to kill everything on the map before the clock hit zero. However, if it hits zero, the next wave will come.\n\n* After you finish the \"Remaining Kills\" (For example, 12 kills from the flag above), the game will give you 5 ability options to choose from. Again and again, you get to choose an ability after each wave.\n\n* From the event page, there are 3 type of ability options to choose from:\n+ Type 1: These increase your character stat (e.g. All attack, crit chance, attack speed, etc.)\n+ Type 2: These increase your character skills (e.g. increase attack, range, decrease cooldown of a particular skill)\n+ Type 3: These are random epic piece (e.g Natural Guardian, Centurion Hero, etc)\n\n* As you can see, there're some RNG involved in this event, sometime you get good options to pick from and sometime you get jack nothing. But regardless, I will give you some recommendation on which one should you pick to help you get as close as wave 50 as possible.\n\nGeneral Strategy* What options should you pick LAST?\n+ Critical Chance: When I first started doing this dungeon, I thought to myself, \"Well, gear doesn't affect my stat, but if I can get my crit rate up, I can kill things faster\". But I was wrong, although crit rate is important, it still doesn't give you the best benefit.\n+ HP\/MP regeneration: This usually only a problem during your first 10-20 waves, I found myself run low at 30-40% MP. From my runs, if you have to, 1 HP\/MP regen should be enough to last the whole dungeon.\n+ Movement\/Casting\/Attack Speed: This option is not bad, however, if you get \"Full Plate Armor\" piece as an option, pick that instead and it should provide you with plenty of speed.\n+ Physical\/Magical Defense: Personally, I don't recommend you pick this one. Higher wave mob (30+ wave) are really strong, most of them 1 shot you anyway. There're just way better options to pick.\n\n* Which options should you pick FIRST and FOCUS on?\n+ After looking though various\u00a0Youtube videos, the main strategy is to pick and stack one skill as much as you can. So whenever you can, try to pick That Skill first.\n+ Secondly, Epic pieces will give you huge boost. Many of them give you Skill Level (Centurion Hero\u00a0), Decrease Skill Cooldown (Eternally Flowing Path\u00a0), Super Armor & Speed (Full Plate Armor\u00a0), Skill Attack (Elemental Dropper\u00a0), many many more.\n+ With mobs from wave 30+ getting more and more annoying, many of them stun and one-shot you. There are many instances where 20 of them stun me over and over, I was pretty much killed and couldn't do anything. As you can see, if you can get an epic that give you Super Armor, Speed or Invulnerability, try to grab those.\n+ Lastly, All Attack +10% option is great to get too.\n\nExample using Female Sader* Below are the options I picked during a run. I was able to get to wave 42 before getting one-shotted. Hopefully with enough practice and good RNG, I can get to wave 50.\n* As you can see, I stacked\u00a0Uriel's Ward\u00a0\u00a0as much as I can. The range of this is skill is huge, it also provide I-frame for you. The more you stack this skill, you can just spam it.\n* I also got plenty of epic pieces and Attack damage. I got some Physical\/Magical Defense, Critical Chances as well because those are the only decent option during those waves.\n\n\n","533":"\n\n* NOTE: This article is a direct archive of Yong\\*'s translation.

Certain debuff \u201cthat will force players to completely change the game style\u201d will be casted if the level drops to a certain level.\n+ Interactive Difficulty selection: Raid members will be able to change the difficulty of raid interactively during the raid (Instead of choosing \u201cHard Ozma raid\u201d at the start, the difficulty and the reward would fluctuate depending on path players take during the raid. I.E. skipping x maps will increase the raid difficulty to high, but doing y maps will decrease it back to normal, or even to an easy-mode raid.)\n+ Reward Auction: Raids cleared with Hard difficulty will have a chance to encounter \u201cJackpot Reward\u201d (on top of normal rewards that every member receives) that will be put up on auction within the raid. Players will bid gold to win the prize, and gold from the winning bid will be distributed among the raid.\n\n* Xlation Note: From the language he uses, it seems like this \u201cMega Flip\u201d will happen on top of normal gold cards.\n+ My attempt as an analogy to Sirocco raid (100% MY GUESS):\n+ Extra Account bound mats, Sirocco Epics, Monster Cards, Weapon Residue would be Normal Gold flip (players win individually)\n+ Mythic and Primal Dream Weapons (PoW) would be put up on Auction.\n\nFull Note* Greetings, This is Jeong Ho Kang, Lead Director of DnF\n* First, we thank every adventurer playing and observing Dungeon and Fighter as it progresses.\n* This Director\u2019s Note will focus on improvements on Sirocco Farming and new mechanics currently under development for the upcoming (within first half of this year) Ozma raid .\n\nSirocco Farming Improvements* Considerable amount of time has passed since Sirocco Raid has been released, and many adventurers made significant progress in farming their gears.\n* However, we acknowledge that many are struggling to graduate due to the RNG nature of the raid, as well as many newcomers who started farming later than others.\n\n* With anticipation of the upcoming Ozma raid, we wanted many more people to attend the new raid with satisfactory gears. Thus, we allowed the players to buy Residue with a set amount of Petals, as well as introduce a method to fuse \u201cdeadweight pieces\u201d into a random piece from the selected set.\n\n* We also decreased the cost of Sirocco Ditto, materials needed to convert the ditto, and removed the petal cost to defuse Sirocco Epic, as an attempt to decrease the overall cost of changing Sirocco gears to the desired set.\n* Above improvements will be implemented in Live server on April 1st, and we anticipate this to benefit not only those struggling, but also allow graduated characters to grow even stronger (optimize with stronger set).\n* With more people trying their best to prepare their characters for the Ozma raid, we (neople) will also try our best to develop a high quality raid.\n\nNew Raid: Ozma Raid* We are developing multiple new mechanics in an attempt to appeal \u201cOzma\u201d to as many adventurers as possible, from those who remember him in Otherverse dungeons to new adventurers who have never heard of an Apostle named Ozma.\n* Today, I am introducing a few of the many systems we are currently developing.\n* First, \u201cSanity Level\u201d mechanic.\n+ Adventurers fighting Ozma in \u201cDark Side\u201d will be under the influence of Ozma. Each player will have its own \u201cSanity Level\u201d gauge that will fluctuate depending on the battles fought against the mobs.\n+ Players who lost sanity (gauge hits 0) will receive significant debuff that will put them in disadvantageous position, thus we expect the players to pay close attention to their gauge.\n+ Additionally, we will implant various gimmicks to utilize the Sanity Level, one of which the raid (as a whole) can upgrade to soothe the subjugation process.\n+ We are avoiding this system from becoming dull by only encouraging players to maintain high sanity. For example, certain stats (damages) would be amplified at low sanity (as a reward for taking high risk). We are striving this new mechanic to be as dynamic as possible.\n\n* Next is the interactive difficulty selection, first introduced in \u201cDark Purgatory\u201d dungeon.\n+ Xlation note: Dark Purgatory has a mechanism where players choose the difficulty (up to 4 levels) depending on what path the party takes. Instead of choosing \u201cHard mode\u201d at the start like P. War, every party starts at level 1, and will be given the option of increasing the difficulty to receive better rewards. Oculus has a similar mechanism where players can choose to skip Luiese or Roseberry to change the difficulty of Shoyun but it doesnt change the rewards. In Black Purgatory, and the Ozma raid, the party will receive additional rewards for taking the harder route.\n+ We added an interactive method of difficulty to give players freedom to make decisions based on the current situation (being able to decide AFTER observing the power level and pattern proficiency of the party).\n+ However, we noticed that the current system implanted in Black Purgatory provides an insufficient amount of freedom to make optimal decisions. In Ozma raid, we will allow players to not only increase the difficulty of the raid, but also an option to revert the choice to provide even more degree of freedom.\n+ We are hoping players to take a shot at challenge mode without burden of risk.\n\n* Finally, We are planning to introduce first ever (in DnF history) system: Raid Auction System.\n+ Xlation note: This system has been in WoW for eons, but the raid leader was able to lead the auction (for whom to attend, and how the item and gold to be distributed, etc). I was told other kMMOs such as Lost Ark and Blade&Soul have similar systems\u2026 but there has always been some degree of controversy in each of the games. I am both excited and worried about this system, especially knowing how prevalent \u201csells\u201d are in the endgame contents of DNF.\n+ Will customers be able to attend the auction? Will they receive the cut of the winning bid? Would it be fair? Will \u201cfriendship\u201d between static raid members be at risk? Who knows. We don\u2019t even know if this system will be 100% automatic by the game, or raid leaders (or players) would have influence in the process.\n\n* Throughout many raids, we found the need of raid scale \u201cfeedback\\*\u201d on top of the individual feedback that previous raids provided..\n+ Xlation note:\u00a0\\*Kang uses word \u201cfeedback\u201d to mean \u201crush of Adrenaline\u201d or \u201csense of winning\u201d\n\n* Thus we are preparing to implant a Raid Auction system to Ozma raid.\n* Normal Rewards will be provided to every participant similar to Sirocco raid, while the raid cleared in certain difficulty will drop a shared loot that can be auctioned among the raid participants. Player with the highest bid will win the item.\n* Additionally, we are designing a system where the gold from the winning bid can be distributed among the raid members to allow other players to enjoy the sense of victory.\n* On top of systems introduced in this note, we will try our best to make Dungeon and Fighter as enjoyable as possible to our adventurers.\n* Thank you.\n\nReferencesKDnF Director's Note  \nYong\\*'s Translation\n\n","534":"\n\n* Othello is old board game invented back in 1971, which is a version of the original\u00a0Reversi game of the late 1800s. You can learn more about it in this\u00a0wikipedia page.\n* In a nutshell, when you place a piece down, any pieces of your opponent that are located in between your pieces will turn into yours. Using example below, when Red place a piece on C5, the blue pieces on D5 and E5 turns into red because they are \"surrounded\" by red on the ends (C5 and F6).\n\n* So you keep playing until there are no more spaces to play. Then at the end, whoever has more pieces will win.\n* This is a game strategy, and here I will show you some tips to help you win.\n\nTip #1: Prioritize the space you want to put your piece on* Generally, the edges of the board are your top priority, especially the corners.\n* If you can, these corners should be your #1 pick, the reason is that there is no way you can lose that piece.\n* Here's an example, I got my piece on the corner of A8, and it gave give me an advantage across the board, vertically horizontally and diagonally. So I put my piece on F3, and turn the entire row.\n\n* Below is another example of Red player utilizing the edge pieces to overtake the whole row.\n\n  \nTip #2: Avoid the RED Zones* Below are the red zones, where you should try your best to avoid playing your pieces on. The reason is that if you place your piece on these slots, you give your opponent the opportunity to take over the edges (remember tip #1?)\n* HOLD ON, 8 of those slots are also the edges, which you told me to take priority on. Why you're telling me now that they are red zones?\n\n  \n* The reason is that if you put your piece there, now you opponent can have the chance to take the corner piece, which is the last thing you want. I'll give you an example.\n* Starting from the left picture, the Red player thought that he could be smart and place the piece on H2, thus taking out 3 of my pieces (middle picture). However, by doing so, he gave me the opportunity to place my Blue piece on the corner of H1.\n\n  \n* So in the end, think of these 8 slots as more of Yellow zone instead of Red. They are good to take advantage of, but at the same time, proceed with caution.\n\n\n","535":"\n\n* This artbook package was announced during the 2020 Winter Festival as part of celebrating DnF 15th anniversary.\n* This article outlines its physical and digital contents.\n* SPECIAL THANKS to Yong\\* for providing numerous images and footages to the artbooks.\n\nTable of Contents* How Much & Where Can I Get One?\n* What's in the box?\n+ Book 1\n- Prologue & Chapter 1\n- Chapter 2 & 3: Character designs\n- Female Priest Illustrations\n- Male Gunner Illustrations\n- Female Slayer Illustrations\n- New 5th Female Slayer\n\n+ Book 2\n- Prey Raid Illustrations\n- Sirocco Raid Illustrations\n\n+ Pixel Art Book\n+ Posters\n+ Digital Contents\n\n* References\n\n\nHow Much & Where Can I Get One?* This package costs 78,000 Won, which is equivalent to about $69 USD, excluding shipping & handling.\n\n* You can get it through 4 websites:\n+ Yes24.com: Sold Out\n+ Book.interpark.com: Sold Out\n+ Kyobobook.co.kr: Sold Out\n+ Aladin.co.kr: Sold Out\n\n\n\nWhat's in the box?\n\n* Within this treasure you will find 2 big art books that contain illustration of characters, monsters, apostles, dungeons, and many more.

Once you entered, your basic objective is to clear each floor and get as high as you can. Unfortunately, you only given 1 min to clear each floor, so looks like this content won't be easy at all.\n\n  \n* The reward concept is similar to \"Spirit Heaven\", the system will give you a rank and the corresponded amount of \"Ancient Gold Coin\" depends on how high you got.\n* You can retreat at any time, but you will have to restart at floor 1, and the floor you have cleared won't give you any coin. Same for if you fail, you will restart at floor 1.\n* So in a nutshell, you can use 6 characters per week to gather up to the max of 1,500 Ancient Gold Coin.\n\nAncient Gold Coin Shop* Random level 100 epic weapon, cost 2,250 coins. Note that they have each box for each weapon type too.\n* Random level 100 epic\/mythic Armor\/Accessory\/Special Equipment, cost 2,250 coins.

So who knows if this will ever get to other game version.\n\n  \nEDIT 4\/20\/2021* New items had been added to the shop. You can now buy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\n+ 1,200\u00a0\u00a0for 250 Ore of Despair (limit 16 purchases per character).\n+ 2,400\u00a0\u00a0for 1 Pupil of Fear (limit 4 purchases per character).\n+ 2.400\u00a0\u00a0for 22 Petal Quartz (unlimited purchase).\n* I also changed the name for this dungeon to Crypts of Fallen Souls, I think this it fits better.\nReferenceshttp:\/\/df.nexon.com\/df\/cast\/article\/MDU3OTghttps:\/\/curyboy.tistory.com\/548\n\n","540":"\n\n* Want to know what to pick for\u00a0Moment of Truth?\n* This article outlines what were released with Male Mage 3A, along with events.\n\n* Overview\n+ This update adds 3rd awakening for all Male Mage classes. Each class gets one passive, one skill and one awakening, all brand new. This patch also provides various skill damage buffs.\n+ Class artworks and details are located in\u00a0Neople official website.\n\n* Events\n+ They Who Engulfed the Abyss\n+ Moment of Truth\n+ Spring is in the Abyss\n\n* Sales\n+ Return to Harlem Package\n\n* Comments\n+ Return to Harlem Package\n- I think this package is very budget to gear up your alt. The title is only 10% modifier, but that's still better than having no title at all.\n- The bonus boxes are nice, especially the Remy's Sparkling Touch, 500 count for about 2.3 mil gold on auction hall is not a bad price.\n\n+ They Who Engulfed the Abyss\n- Simple generic 3A event, nothing really special here\n\n+ Spring is in the Abyss\n- Nice exp capsule and level up ticket\n- BUT:\u00a0The background image can be used until 09:00, DEC 31, 2021 UTC. Why??? I was hoping it would be permanent.\n\nMoment of Truth* Think of this as an upgraded honey time. I love that they give us options. So which one should you choose? this event last for 28 days\n* With rewards from 15 mins, you can get:\n+ 2,800\u00a0, which is enough to buy 4 tayberr pieces. This really is the best option to pick because you can eventually use them to upgrade to Super-Tayberr then upgrade to level 100 epics. You can learn more in this\u00a0How to Upgrade Level 95 Epics to Level 100 Epics.\n+ 8,400\u00a0, which is enough for 14 Ghent pieces. Not really worth it since you can farm all 12 pieces in like 2 days, so there's no reason to wait 28 days for this.\n+ 2,800\u00a0, which is enough for about 5 non-weapon swap pieces. This is probably your second best option if one of your alt still need buff swap pieces.\n\n* With rewards from 30 mins, you can get:\n+ 2,800\u00a0, which is plenty to upgrade one 95 epic to 100 epic. This is your best option, looking at my 1,000 Black Shrine & Basement of Pain runs, this many mats is equivalent to about 46 days worth of doing 2+2 on one character. So if you're new and only have 1 character, this is 46 days of progress in 28 days.\n+ 1,400\u00a0, which is not even enough to buy 1 Dark Dimension Piece. Looking at my Dark Dimension small data, this is only 12 days worth of progress. So this option is not recommended.\n+ 2,240\u00a0, which is only enough to buy 1 legendary piece. Looking at my Land of Memory and Bottomless Tunnel data, this is about 3.7 days worth of progress. So, yeah, terrible option to pick.\n\n* With\u00a0 rewards from 60 mins, you can get: 83 days worth of Contract, 280\u00a0, or 84\u00a0. Really up to you. Contract is probably the best option, creature food and potions are cheap to get from package's bonuses.\n* With rewards from 120 mins, you can get 560\u00a0, 84\u00a0, or 28\u00a0. I think the Stone is probably your best option. If you were gonna buy the\u00a0\u00a0from the action hall and convert to 560\u00a0, that's about 26 million gold worth.\n\n\n\n","541":"\n\n* As a Beat-'em-up MMORPG game, DFO has a function that allowing you to manually assign commands to all your skills.\n* Here I'll go over some simple tips & tricks so you can get the most benefit out of this system.\n\nWhy Would You Use This?* You only have 12 quick slots. Well, every class in the game has at least 1 buff skills, among many many other skills.\u00a0So you will not always have enough space to put them.\n* Take Female Nen for example, she has at least 3 buffs that I cast at the beginning of every dungeon\u00a0. If I put those 3 on the hot bar, where would I put the other skills.\n* How about Female Spitfire, I need to cast 3 buffs\u00a0, so there's no way I would have enough space for other skills if I put them on the hot bar. If you play sader classes, you will even need more manual skills.\n\nHow to Assign Manual?* First, click on a skill, then click \"Change\".\n* A window will open where you can put in whatever manual you in it.\n\nGeneral Principles* A manual input usually contain a set of arrow key and one letter.\n* So which letter can you use? There're only 4 letters you can use. They're letter used for \"Skill\", \"Skill2\", \"Normal Attack\", and \"Jump\" skills. You can see which those letters are under \"Settings\" then \"Hotkey Settings\".\n\n* As you can see, my \"Skill\", \"Skill2\", \"Normal Attack\", and \"Jump\" skills are Z, Space, X, and C. So I can only use those for manual input.\n* What do input usually consist of?\u00a0In a nutshell, at least 1 arrow key & 1 letter. For example, most of my character's buff skills are \"\u2191+Space\"\n+ You can register up to to 4 arrow keys, so go ham and be creative. You can use whatever input as long as you follow those simple principles. For example, \"\u2190\u2193\u2192\u2192 +C\", \"\u2190\u2193\u2192+Z, \"\u2193\u2193\u2191\u2191+Space\", etc.\n\n* Can you just put a letter?\u00a0Yes, a manual input can just be a letter (for example, Z or Space). HOWEVER, you CANNOT use Normal Attack key and Jump key by themselves.\n\nWhat Key To Avoid* I would say don't use the \"Jump\" key as an input because it can get confusing because sometime in dungeon, you want to jump to avoid certain gimmicks.\n* I would avoid using \"\u2192\u2192 + Normal Attack\" as a manual, especially if you're a gunner. Because that's the combination for doing run and dash move.\n  \nWhich Skill?* Which skill should you use manual inputs? Generally speaking, buff skills are the ones you don't really want to put on hot bar. I put all my buff skill on all my character as \"\u2191+Space\".\n* High cooldown skills are good options, such a 1st 2nd or 3rd Awakening skills. I have the majority of my Awakening skills as \"\u2191\u2191+C\" and \"\u2193\u2193+C\".\n* For example: My female sader, I used \"\u2193\u2193+C\" for 3A, then when that's going, I used \"\u2191\u2191+C\" for 1A.\nProTip* Not many people know this, but this system can register an arrow as HOLD. On the command, you will see it register as \"\u2191&\" (right pic) instead of \"\u2191+\" (left pic).\n* To register this, simple press the arrow key, hold it for a few seconds, then register you letter key. Note that if you use this hold function, you can only use ONE arrow key.\n\n* Why does this hold function matter? Well, you can use this as a \"combo\" manual. In stead of using 2 different manuals for 2 skills, you can now just use 1 similar input.\n* For example: For my Female Nen, I used \"\u2191+Space\" for\u00a0, then \"\u2191&Space\" for\u00a0.\n+ Remember the Hold function? After casting\u00a0, because I already have my finger on the \u2191 arrow (it will register it as a hold), now all I need is to press \"Space\" again for\u00a0.\n+ So instead of using like \"\u2191+Space\" and \"\u2191\u2191+Space\" for 2 skills, I pressed \"\u2191+Space+Space\" and casted 2 skills spontaneously.\n* Here's another example using THREE skills:\n+ I used \"\u2191+Space\" for\u00a0, \"\u2193+Space\" for\u00a0, then \"\u2193&Space\" for\u00a0.\n+ Why the Down arrow? because after casting\u00a0, the Down function is \"Neutral Bullet\" which increases Skill attack.\n\n+ So \"\u2191+Space\" to cast\u00a0, then since my finger already on \u2193 arrow after picking the element, I pressed Space to cast\u00a0, THEN since my finger already HOLD \u2193 arrow, I pressed Space again to cast\u00a0.\n+ There you go, I pressed \"\u2191+Space+\u2193+Space+Space\" to cast 3 skills spontaneously like a pro.\n\n\n\n","542":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2208\/Many-Thanks-from-Mia?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","543":"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 1.

Adventurers must defeat Gizel's powerful weapons, including G\u00e1e Bulga, with the help of the 7 Meisters.\n+ Starting with this Meister's\u00a0Laboratory, I would like to tell you about the changes in the difficulty direction of advanced dungeons in the future.\n+ Existing advanced dungeons are designed to be able to proceed without unreasonable difficulty in clearing them once the entry is possible. The reason was to minimize the hurdles for entering and clearing content in the early stages of growth and farming.\n+ However, the advanced dungeons that will be updated from Meister's Lab in the future aim to become content that you want to challenge and clear. For this reason, advanced dungeons are expected to be applied as a \"minimum admission standard\" rather than a \"appropriate playable standard\" as a challenging content.\n* Story: A laboratory where 7 Meister finally conducted the secret project \"Code Name G\u00e1e Bulga\" to defeat Bakal.\n+ While developing G\u00e1e Bulga, numerous security systems and weapons were deployed to fend off possible intruders, and it consists of a maze-like complex passageway.\n+ Except for Eternal Flame, who guards the laboratory with the 7 Meister , no one will be able to pass through this territory safely.\u200b\n\n* Arts & Illustrations:\n+ Main Art:\u00a01024 \u2715 768 | 1280\u00a0\u2715\u00a01024 | 1680\u00a0\u2715\u00a01050 | 1920\u00a0\u2715\u00a01080\u00a0| 3200\u00a0\u2715\u00a01800\n+ Monster:\u00a0GB-1 Haps |\u00a0GB-2 Identate |\u00a0GB-3 Energi |\u00a0GB-4 Diregent |\u00a0GB-5 Feluhan Stark\n+ Area:\u00a0G\u00e1e Bulga Field |\u00a0Meister's Lab | Weapons Depot | Power Charging Room |\u00a0Energy Production Room |\u00a0Automatic Response Room |\u00a0G\u00e1e Bulga Boarding Point\n+ NPC:\u00a0Meister Jenne |\u00a0Meister Eldirh |\u00a0Meister Rati\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Teneb\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Volgan\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Curio\u00a0|\u00a0Meister Odruz\n\n* Fame Requirement: 26,933 (Normal) 31,795 (Expert) 34,198 (Master)\n* Entry Material:\u00a0\u00a0Meister's Laboratory Admission Ticket + 30 FP\n+ Each difficulty will have their own ticket. If you buy the Expert ticket, you can also enter normal mode. If you buy Master ticket, you can also enter expert and normal mode.\n\n* Dungeon Information:\n+ Time Limit: A 30-minute time limit applies at the start of the content. As long as you do not leave the party, you can continue to challenge for a limited time.\n+ Dungeon Abandon:\u00a0The party leader can retreat from the dungeon using the retreat button on the status board. When retreating, re-entry to the dungeon is not possible for a certain period of time. When retreating, the skill cooldown is maintained. After retreating, you can select 'Abandon mission' through NPC 'Meister Curio'. All dungeon progress will reset and entry materials will not be returned.\n+ Combat Restrictions: When using coins in the dungeon, the skill cooldown is maintained\n\n\n\nDungeon Progression* Operation Deterrence:\n+ Players can use the EF-MK1 vehicle to block the movement of G\u00e1e Bulga.\n+ One EF-MK1\u200b vehicle can be boarded by one driver\/one anti-aircraft gunner by entering the 'Z' key, respectively.\n- Up to 2 vehicles will be prepared.\n- If only the driver is in the EF-MK1\u200b vehicle, the AI \u200b\u200bwill fire instead.\n- The vehicle's defense changes according to the driver's reputation.\n- The vehicle's attack power is changed according to the anti-aircraft gunner's reputation.\n\n+ You can block the movement of the G\u00e1e Bulga by reducing the HP of one of the parts to 0.\n+ You can identify your vehicle with the icon ().\n+ When the vehicle's health is exhausted, all players in the vehicle will die. Players can be revived using coins (player in driver's seat will get priority).\n\n\n| Type | Key | Icon | Function |\n| Common | Tab |  | Swap The Positions Of The Driver's Seat And Gunner SeatBullets\/Missiles Are Recharged.\u200b |\n| Driver's Seat | Arrow Keys | - | Move The Vehicle Up, Down, Left, Or Right |\n| A |  | The Vehicle Dashes Forward Quickly |\n| C |  | The Vehicle Jumps Upwards |\n| Gunner\u2019s Seat | A |  | Fires Bullets |\n| S |  | Launch Missiles |\n\n* Infiltration Operation:\u200b\n+ The pattern of certain monsters will be weakened depending on the part the player destroys in the Deterrence Operation.\n+ You can finally clear the dungeon by defeating 'GB-1 Haps' located in the center of the Meister Lab.\nChanges From Test Server* A security system is added to the Meister's laboratory. When defeating a boss except for GB-1 Haps, a security system is activated.\n* This security system increases the attack power of all enemy monsters. During this time, some computers on the map become hackable. Successfully hack those computers will disable the security system and apply various effects to other bosses.\n\n* If the security system is hacked using a computer, the security system level will be lowered.\n+ When the security system is successfully hacked, some bosses will have a functional error effect.\n+ For functional errors, attack power increase and defense decrease are applied at each stage.\n+ If the security system hack fails, nothing happens.\n\n* The attack power of monsters appearing in Meister's Lab is readjusted.\n* GB-1 Haps' attack pattern has been added and changed.\n* GB-2 Identitate level 3 enhanced monsters have been changed to 2 monsters.\n* GB-3 Energi's attack pattern has been added and changed.\n\n\n\nScenario Dungeon Rewards\n\n|  | Normal | Expert | Master | King | Tradability |\n| 105 Rare Equipment | X |  |  |  | Tradable |\n| 105 Unique Equipment | X | X |  |  | Untradable |\n| 105 Epic Equipment(Fixed Option) | X | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Frost Crystal Fragments | X | X |  |  | Untradable |\n| Shining Frost Crystal Fragments | X | X |  |  | Account-Bound |\n| Ominous Crystal |  | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Resonant Ominous Crystal |  | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Ryan Core |  | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Golden Beryl |  | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n\n  \n\n\nAdvance Dungeon Rewards\n\n| \u00a0 | Normal | Expert | Master | Tradability |\n| 105 Epic Equipment(Fixed Option) | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| \u200b105 Epic Equipment(Custom Option) | \u00a0 | X | X | Untradable |\n| 105 Legendary Equipment | X\u00a0 | X | X | Tradable(Sealed) |\n| Fragment Of The Deep Abyss | X | X | X | Tradable(Cannot Be Exchanged When Worn, Cannot Be Resealed)\u00a0 |\n| Abyss Battery | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| High Efficiency Abyss Battery | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Condensed Ryan Core | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Shining Harmony Crystal | X\u00a0 | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Flawless Golden Beryl | X | X | X | Tradable |\n| Carbon-14 Crystals | X | X | X | Untradable |\n| Meister's Lab (Normal) Admission Ticket | X | \u00a0 | \u00a0 | Tradable(1 Time) |\n| Meister's Lab (Expert) Admission Ticket | X\u00a0 |  | \u00a0 | Untradable |\n| Meister's Lab (Expert) Admission Ticket |  | X |  | Tradable(1 Time) |\n| Meister's Lab (Master) Admission Ticket | \u00a0 | X | X | Untradable |\n| Meister's Lab (Master) Admission Ticket | \u00a0 | \u00a0 | X | Tradable(1 Time) |\n| Monster Card | X | X | X | Tradable(1 Time) |\n\n  \n\n\nNew 105 Epics* New level 105 Epics that can be obtained from Meister's Lab Advanced Dungeon are added.\n+ 11 new fixed optional epic (1 type for each part excluding weapons)\n+ 11 new custom optional epic (1 type for each part excluding weapons)\n\n* The following 11 epics are originally translated by DFOG previous Content Creator \"Yong\\*\", and reworded by me (Raven).\n* Metal Gear Arm Shoulder\u00a0(\uba54\ud0c8\uae30\uc5b4 \uc554 \uc204\ub354)\n+ Option 1: Receive a buff \"+25% cooldown recovery\" upon entry (except awakenings)\n- For every 6 combo, skill recovery \u22125% (up to 5 stacks) (i.e. cooldown gets longer)\n- For every skill used, reduce the penalty stack by 1 (i.e. +5% cooldown recovery)\n\n+ Option 2: Apply buff \"+2,223 Damage Amplification\" upon entry\n- Combo duration \u22120.5%\n\n+ Option 3: +5% physical \/ magical critical rate\n+ Option 4: +5% MAX MP\n\n* Confused Core Suits: Top (\ucee8\ud4e8\uc988\ub4dc \ucf54\uc5b4 \uc288\ud2b8)\n+ Option 1: For every cube skill, summon D011-Risa (0.5 sec cooldown, up to 5 summons)\n- Apply every aliment that the strongest mob on the map has to Risa (synergize with the next option)\n- If you are within 500px of Risa, gain 2% aliment resistance of the aliment\u00a0that Risa has (up to 5 stacks)\n\n+ Option 2: For every aliment resistance gained from Risa, 5% additional aliment damage (up to 10%)\n- Note: So with combination of option 1 and 2, you get 10% more burning \/ shocking \/ cursed \/ freeze damage.\n\n+ Option 3: P+5% physical \/ magical critical rate\n+ Option 4: \u22127% MP consumption\n\n* Robotica Combat Pants\u00a0(\ub85c\ubcf4\ud2f0\uce74 \ucef4\ubc43 \ud32c\uce20)\n+ Option 1: For every 6 amplification \/ reinforcement of your equipped slot, +272 Damage Amplification\u00a0(up to 24 stacks)\n- This is 100% whale item.

a new difficulty level is added to the level 110 general dungeon, the item option level of Heroes Mode difficulty will be adjusted.\n* This change is applied to level 105 Epic equipment item drop, and you can check it in the expected reward and equipment guide in the dungeon selection window.\n\n\n| Difficulty | Before | After |\n| Hero Normal | 18 ~ 43 | 23 ~ 48 |\n| Hero Expert | 18 ~ 48 | 23 ~ 53 |\n| Hero Master | 18 ~ 53 | 23 ~ 58 |\n| Hero King | 18 ~ 58 | 23 ~ 63 |\n| Hero Slayer | - | 23 ~ 68 |\n\n  \n\n\nLevel 110 Normal Dungeon Farming Improvements(Added with Live Server)* Dev's Note: We have confirmed that those who develop characters with an adventurer fame of less than 24,000 as their mains are having difficulties in the process of growing the option level for 105 Epic.\n+ In particular, we identified the most problematic part was that it was difficult to figure out how to efficiently grow with several equipment already acquired.\n+ Accordingly, it has been decided to add one new Level 105 Epic equipment for each part (excluding weapons). These equipment are \"only for optional growth materials\", and drop more in general dungeons with slayer difficulty or lower.\n\n* 11 new level 105 epic equipment are added for the purpose of \"only for optional growth materials\". The equipment has the following features:\n+ There is 1 type each in 11 slots other than weapons.\n+ There are no other options other than the damage increase option.\n+ When used as a material in the option growth system, the option level and experience are added to this equipment as it is, regardless of the equipment's options.\n+ It can be obtained from the following dungeons and does not affect the drop rate of existing epic equipment.\n\n* 110 Level Normal Dungeon Normal ~ Slayer Difficulty (Excluding Heroes Mode)\n+ Vericollis: top, bottom\n+ White Land: Bracelets, Rings\n+ Canyon Hills: Necklace, Accessories\n+ Queen Fallt: head, shoulder, bottom\n+ Nasau Forest: Accessories, Earrings\n+ Eternal Flame Lab: Shoes, Waist\n+ King\u2019s Cradle: Bracelet, Magic Stone\n+ Heblon's Prophecy: Top, Waist\n+ 100~110 Lv Scenario Dungeon All Difficulty\n+ Meister's Lab Scenario Dungeon All Difficulty\n\n* It cannot be used in the option transfer system and the option level transfer system.\n* Material change, equipment grade change, and all enchantment systems cannot be used.\n* Cannot be obtained from random pots or selection boxes.\n* Compared to other 105 Level Epic equipment, the adventurer's reputation is set lower.\n\n* Dev's Note: Since the value of the types of rewards that can be obtained when playing on Normal Mode difficulty in Level 110 normal dungeons is low, we are trying to improve it.\n+ First, in Gabriel's secret shop and urgent mission rewards of Expert ~ Slayer difficulty, we have changed so that you can acquire Noblesse Code tickets and Destroyed Castle of the Dead with maximum expert difficulty.\n+ And it has been changed to acquire level 105 epic equipment up to option level 58 with a low probability in Normal ~ Slayer difficulty, and in emergency missions, it has been changed to acquire level 105 epic equipment of higher option level.\n+ Lastly, we have doubled the drop rate of level 105 Epic equipment, limited to Normal difficulty.\n\n* The sales list and probability of Gabriel's Secret Shop in Level 110 Normal Dungeon Expert ~ Slayer difficulty are readjusted. In the case of Expert difficulty, the probability of selling tickets is set lower than in Master ~ Slayer difficulty.\n\n\n\n| Sale Item | Difficulty\u00a0 | Tradability |\n| Expert | Master | King | Slayer |\n| Level 105 Epic (Fixed Option) | X | X | \u00a0X | X\u00a0 | Untradable |\n| Resonant Ominous Crystals | X\u00a0 | X\u00a0 | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Golden Beryl | \u00a0X | X\u00a0 | X\u00a0 | X\u00a0 | Account-Bound |\n| Condensed Ryan Core | X | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Essence Of The Rift |  | X | X | X | Tradable |\n| Noblesse Code (Normal) Admission Ticket | Addition | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Destroyed Castle Of The Dead (Normal) Admission Ticket | Addition | X | X | X | Account-Bound |\n| Noblesse Code (Expert) Admission Ticket | Addition | Addition | Addition | Addition | Account-Bound |\n| Destroyed Castle Of The Dead (Expert) Admission Ticket | Addition | Addition | Addition | Addition | Account-Bound |\n\n* The list and probability of the urgent mission reward list are readjusted in Level 110 Normal Dungeon Expert ~ Slayer difficulty.

However, please note that the probability of being dropped to an option level higher than the 'Main Item Option Level' is very low, so it is not indicated in the Dungeon Expectation Reward UI.\n\n\n| Difficulty(Level 100~110 Scenario DungeonMaster's Lab Scenario Dungeon) | Difficulty(Level 110 Normal Dungeon) | Before Change | After Change | After Change(Emergency Mission) |\n| Normal \/ Expert \/ Master | Normal \/ Expert | 1~30 | 1~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 1~20) | 10~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 10~30) |\n| King | Master | 10~40 | 10~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 10~30) | 18~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 18~38) |\n| - | King | 18~48 | 18~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 18~38) | 23~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 23~43) |\n| - | Slayer | - | 23~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 23~43) | 23~58(Main Acquisition Item Option Level: 23~48) |\n\n* The drop rate of Level 105 Epic equipment has been doubled in Level 110 Normal Dungeon Normal difficulty. The same applies to level 100~110 scenario dungeons and Meister's lab scenario dungeon expert difficulty.\n\n\nItem Recommendation Board* Dev's Note: \u200bAfter reaching level 110, the item recommendation board allows you to check recommended items based on class, and was added in anticipation that it will be helpful for farming. We are planning to provide various conveniences in the future.\n* The item recommendation bulletin board is divided into an item tab and a combination search tab, and items are recommended in different ways. This board will be available in various endgame dungeon areas.\n* Item tab:\n+ The Item tab shows recommended items for each part based on the class, and you can also check the recommended items of other characters by changing the class.\n\n* Item selection:\n+ You can select an item by clicking the left mouse button, and you can check the acquisition information of the selected item.\n+ Also, a menu for \"Combination Search\" is activated when right-clicking the mouse.\n+ If you select 'Combination Search', you can check various combinations based on the selected item.\n\n* Combination search:\n+ Combination search allows you to check various combinations based on the selected item.\n\n* Check the combination:\n+ Based on the selected item, the item is recommended after searching for an item with the same remaining parts.\n+ Recommended item efficiency is not an indicator of the best efficiency, so only use it for reference purposes.\n\n* Hashtags:\n+ You can check the characteristics of the combined item with a hashtag that is duplicated in the combined searched item.\n+ Non-duplicate hashtags are not displayed.\n\n\n\nImprovements and Changes* Improved display of equipped equipment\u00a0(Added with Live Server)\n+ Equipped equipment UI where you can check\u00a0 currently equipped equipment, all hashtags will be added\n+ In the hashtag information tab, you can check the representative hashtags of the equipment being equipped.\n+ Representative hashtags display the most hashtags among the hashtags included in the device in descending order.\n+ Up to 3 representative hashtags are displayed, and they are displayed as icons on devices that contain the hashtag.\n+ Some hashtags do not appear as representative hashtags.\n+ You can check all hashtags for currently equipped equipment.\n+ Only hashtags that are included in 2 or more parts are displayed for all hashtags displayed.\n+ If you click a hashtag that is displayed, it will be searched for that tag in the encyclopedia.\n+ The hashtags of some equipment have been changed.\n\n  \n* DFO Mission Improvements (Added with Live Server)\n+ Limited missions are added and appear in the rightmost column of DFO Daily Missions.\n\n  \n+ Every day at reset, all progress of limited missions will be reset.\n+ Limited missions cannot be changed and the rest bonus is not affected.\n+ All users are given the same limited mission.\n+ Depending on the level of the current character or the reputation of the adventurer, the mission content is the same, but the mission reward may vary.\n+ Rental equipment is excluded from the criteria for daily\/limited missions that appear for the first time after daily reset.\n+ The list of limited missions to be added is as follows.\n\n\n\n| Condition | Mission Details | Mission Rewards |\n| Level | Adventurer Fame | Daily MissionPoints | Golden Beryl | Ominous Crystal | ResonantOminous Crystal | Limited MissionClear Jar |\n| Level 110 Or Higher | 33,989 Or More | Clear 2 Random Area Dungeons 1 Time (Total 4 Times)\u203b Limited mission exampleClear the dungeon below- Clear White Land 1 time- Clear Vericollis 1 time- Clear Canyon Hill 1 time- Clear Queen Palt 1 time | 100 | 25 | 11 | 11 | 0 |\n| 32,523~33,988 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 11 | 0 |\n| 30,946~32,522 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 10 | 0 |\n| 29,369~30,945 | 100 | 15 | 9 | 10 | 0 |\n| 25,837~29,368 | 100 | 15 | 9 | 9 | 0 |\n| 23,259~25,836 | 100 | 15 | 8 | 9 | 0 |\n| 21,675~23,258 | 100 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 0 |\n| 13,195~21,674 | 100 | 10 | 7 | 8 | 0 |\n| 8,602~13,194 | 100 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 1 |\n| 4,176~8,601 | 100 | 0 | 6 | 6 | 0 |\n| Level 110 Or Higher | 0~4,175 | Appropriate Dungeon Clear 5 Times | 100 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 |\n| Level 100~109 | - | 100 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 |\n\n+ The rewards obtained when clearing daily missions are strengthened. Depending on the mission, different types and numbers of clear rewards are provided. Depending on the current character's level or adventurer's reputation, detailed mission details and mission rewards may vary.\n\n* Improved trigger options when attacking:\n+ Dev's Note: To solve such a problem, it has been improved so that the option is activated even when attacking independent object. However, in the case of the \"option to reduce the enemy's remaining HP\" in the process of improvement, it can inflict strong damage to the enemy even when the character is unable to fight. Therefore, we decided to keep it from being applied to independent objects. In addition, some job advancement has a balance problem due to excessive option activation, so the probability was adjusted separately for each job change and applied.\n+ Among character skills, independent object attacks are improved to be included in the activation conditions when attacking equipment items.\n+ Based on the number of independent objects that can be performed for each class, the probability of option activation when an independent object is attacked is adjusted and applied.\n+ However, the option to reduce the enemy's remaining HP when attacking is not applied.\n+ Activation options when attacking are added to the encyclopedia game terminology\n\n* Adjustment of neutralization gauge reduction efficiency:\n+ Dev's Note: Through specific equipment settings, all characters can have status abnormalities, and it has been confirmed that the efficiency of skills with high hit counts is too good. In addition to this, we are constantly discussing further improvements to the neutralization gauge system, and we are preparing improvements to make it even more fun.\n+ The effectiveness of the neutralization gauge reduction according to the number of hits per skill is adjusted\n\n* Other:\n+ Monster Encyclopedia - Achieved monster grade display is added to the inventory tab.\n+ Play Points - The display of free items is improved.\n+ The number of people entering the dungeon below will be changed from 4 to 2~4, and the pattern of some monsters will change according to the number of people.\n- The Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection\n- The Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum\n- Pandemonium War\n- Pandemonium War Hard\n- Black Purgatory Weekly Dungeon\n\n\nReferencesKDnF Test Server NoteKDnF Live Server Note  \nFixed-option Epic list -\u00a0GameChosun  \nEpic Translation by Yong\\*\n\n","550":"\n\n* As we all expected from Honey Time Event, all you need to do is log in, afk, and get rewards.

It also has 1 special dungeon Tower of Revelation, and 1 camp.\n+ The goal is to clear the main dungeon, Holy Land of Fear, in Crossroad of Terror. In order to enter Crossroad of Terror, you needs to clear the other 2 Crossroads first.\n+ Camp is where your character stay when not entering dungeons. Think of it like a waiting area\n+ Tower of Revelation is a special dungeon that spawns negative effects periodically every time it comes up. If the revelation occurs 3 times, the raid will reset.\n\n* Each Crossroad also has 4 sub-dungeons: Main, Liberation, Chaos, and Secondary.\n+ - Main dungeons: These will clear the crossroad\n+ - Liberation dungeons: You must clear this to enter the main dungeon\n+ - Chaos dungeons: This raises the chaos level of the raid (aka difficulty)\n+ - Secondary Dungeons: This provide buff effects for the raid when cleared.\n\n\n\nPhase 2 Operation Ellerinon: Second Coming of Chaos* Throne of Chaos, the goal is to clear this dungeon to complete the raid. It consists of 3 dungeons. The bosses in there share the same HP value, and the damage inflicted is shared. (just like Sirocco raid where you fight 3 forms)\n* Special Dungeon: City of Tragedy. Once cleared, you can force Ozma to enter a special state (Groggy???). You can only enter this dungeon once you have completed certain conditions.\n* Secondary Dungeon: Garden of Mirrors. Once cleared, it will increase recovery speeds for the people at camp, and also gives damage buffs for everyone. Someone must be fighting Ozma in Throne of Chaos for other party to enter this dungeon.  \n  \n\n\n\nRationale System\n\n* Think of this as your sanity level. Everyone will have their own gauge. This gauge reduces when hit with boss attacks. When it hits zero, you will lose your mind and start to threaten the other members. You can see everyone's gauges by the orange\/purple indicator underneath their party name.\n\n  \n* When your gauge hits zero, you will be teleported to a limbo place where you have to counter attack Ozma's illusion 3 times in order to regain your conscious mind and come back to reality.\n* If you fail to counter attack within the time limit in limbo, you die. If you success, you come back with your gauge turned purple and at 50%. If your purple gauge hit zero again, you die.\n* If everyone gauge in the party hit zero and they're in limbo at the same time, you lose the boss fight immediately.\n* This gauge can be further upgraded\/modified with sigil reward from Ozma raid through Black Earth Engraving System.\n\n\n\nBlack Earth Engraving System* The sigil you get from Ozma will look like the marks below.\n\n* They can be used to upgrade and activate Ozma raid's exclusive stat. Think of it as a way to improve your own Sanity Gauge and to \"gear\" yourself up for harder Ozma difficulty.\n\n* There are 3 type of sigils:\n+ Destruction Sigil: Increase Max Sanity Gauge\n+ Horror Sigil: Increase Max HP\n+ Despair Sigil Increase Damage when Sanity is below certain amount\n\n\n\nAuction System* Newly introduced system with Ozma Raid where players can place bit on the jackpot items.

You can watch the interview in this Youtube video.\n* This interview was about 3 hours long, and the author would like to express special thanks to u\/halfmango08 for the amazing translation.\n\nTable of Contents* First Half-Year Feedback\n+ Growth System\n+ Transfer\/Growth UI\n+ Neutralization System\n+ Character Balancing\n+ Gear Theme\n+ Level 110 Dungeons\n\n* Second Half-Year Roadmap\n+ June 30th (Multi-thread client improvement )\n+ July 7th (Ispins, Stormwrath, Dungeon & Life, Advanced Dungeons Improvement, Training Room Renewal)\n+ August \/ September (Character Renewal & Balancing, Bakal Raid)\n+ October (Advanced Dungeon Expansion, 16:9 widescreen, PVP season 8)\n+ November (Character Renewal \/ Balance, Archmage's Dimensional Corridor)\n+ December (Level 1~100 Scenarios Renewal)\n\n* Other Changes\n* Q&A\n* References\n\n\n\nFirst Half-Year Feedback* Growth System:\n+ The equipment level growth and transfer system itself was the first system introduced in Dungeon & Fighter, so we approached it too carefully. After much thought, the number of growth has increased more than tenfold since the update of the equipment growth system. He expressed his honest opinion, saying what would have happened if these changes had been corrected two to four weeks earlier.\n+ In addition, as an apology for having to rely on 'transfer growth' for equipment option levels at the beginning of the season, we are preparing a plan to calculate the golden beryl used for the 110 level transfer and refund 50% of the amount. It is at the stage of considering the payment method of beryl and promised to refund on July 17th.\n\n* Transfer\/Growth UI:\n+ Because the UI of the growth and transfer system was not intuitive, there were too many cases where precious enchantments such as reinforcement, amplification, and enchantment disappeared in one day by placing the material equipment and the equipment to be received in reverse.\n+ He had a policy of recovering as much as possible from such cases, but there were so many cases that the workload was overloaded. Accordingly, along with a major UI reorganization, the system will be improved so that equipment inheritance can be carried out at once.\n* Neutralization System:\n+ We plan to reorganize the \"neutralization system\" that harms the foundation between characters. He frankly stated that the system that reflects his greed was correct. He said that he wanted to revive the system that was alienated from the boss monster, which was armed with various defense conditions such as immunity to status abnormalities, impossible to hold, and invincibility in order to avoid situations where monsters were unilaterally hit.\n+ However, it is also true that the meta has changed rapidly after the maximum level expansion, and the actual dealing gap between characters who are well-adapted and those who are not is too large. It is difficult to directly adjust the character's balancing for each dungeon or item change, and it is difficult to directly modify the character's unique characteristics because it has to be respected.\n+ Therefore, the neutralization system itself is completely modified. It is reorganized so that the neutralization gauge can be cut even with a normal attack, and in the case of neutralization-type abnormalities, the gauge can be attacked regardless of weakness. In addition, he explained that he thinks that the neutralization state can play a similar role to the groggy time in the future, such as a significant decrease in the neutralization gauge when the monster's pattern is broken.\n\n* Character Balancing:\n+ Skill customizing gear such as talisman and decisive weapons have the merit of being creative and fun, but they also have the problem of characters being skewed when those gears disappear. As weapons would only last a season, they wanted to try something more bold and if necessary move some of its options to the characters via balancing. We realize this hasn\u2019t worked out, and we're sorry.\n+ In addition, they plan to raise the weapon options for classes with an excessively low use rate for Decisive Weapon, and downgrade the weapon options for some classes with too high use rates. The content will be updated as soon as July 7th.\n\n+ The character values \u200b\u200bthemselves are also partially adjusted. Asura, whose own performance is strong, will be slightly downgraded, and character balancing will be carried out for about 7 classes , including Troubleshooter, Male Ranger, and Dark Knight.\n+ Lower difficulties don\u2019t have enough buffers, higher difficulties don\u2019t have enough DPS. Dungeons cannot be balanced without buffers in account as they give so much dmg (almost 10 times with base buff, 20 times with 1a).\n+ This will be drastically reorganized so that you can feel the play experience equivalent to that of a dealer when playing solo. It is scheduled to be renewed in September, and until then, a cool-time reduction buff will be provided to the buffer group to supplement their solo play ability.\n\n* Gear Theme:\n+ It was also mentioned that only certain item combinations are being used. Reorganized to reduce the firepower gap between items. Representatively, the  Golem's Keystone Ring is a powerful piece of equipment that can be mixed with the Akan theme, and the  Unknown Golden Stone is reorganized as a cornerstone of the advanced level enhancement theme.\n+ Some setups (like sleep and petrification) have been designed with future contents such as Ispins and Bakal raid in mind, but obviously they haven\u2019t been able to serve the current meta and have been neglected.\n+ More gear balance incoming to completely revamp unused gears. Internal testing shows that many weaker setups will be vastly improved to be not far behind MP consume + ailment setup (current meta setup).\n\n* Level 110 Dungeons:\n+ Nassau forest is run vastly more than any other dungeon as its mobs have less HP than those of the other dungeons. Furthermore, the belt and shoes of the MP consume pieces also drop in Nassau. Dungeons will be nerfed\/rebalanced to reduce players\u2019 fatigue and alleviate this problem.\n+ Advanced dungeons improvement: golden beryls will be usable to buy the tickets to reduce reliance on burning through fp in normal dungeons to get play points. Tradable golden beryls will also drop guaranteed to stabilize the economy.\n+ Advanced dungeon expansion: Master difficulty will be updated in the future to improve its playability at the point where it starts lagging behind the legion dungeons. Tickets will have effects imbued that may improve rewards, buff players and enemies. Won\u2019t be a \u2018new\u2019 content that must be played.\n+ Meister's Lab: Was harder than it should\u2019ve been as they changed its design from a weekly dungeon to an advanced dungeon during development. Will be massively nerfed to better fit the position & let the players have their revenge.\n\n\nSecond Half-Year Roadmap\n\nJune 30th(Multi-thread client improvement ).embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n\nJuly 7th(Ispins, Stormwrath, Dungeon & Life, Advanced Dungeons Improvement, Training Room Renewal)* Legion Dungeon: Stolen Land, Ispins:\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }+ An adventurer who pursued Sirocco's thoughts meets the cruelest era in the history of the heavens. As the first Legion dungeon, it is a new advanced dungeon classification with strong named and 1:1 battles as the main, and potions and coin restrictions like raids.\n+ You can select a mission before starting a battle, and depending on this, you can get an advantage for monsters or for allies. You can also select the difficulty level in advance to increase the amount of rewards.\n\n+ The core rewards of Ispins Dungeon is the 'fusion system'. We focused on making the character stronger without compromising the existing equipment settings. In addition, in the dungeon reward, fusion equipment does not appear at all, and the \"Complete Price System\" is introduced, which can only be purchased by collecting materials.\n\n\u00a0+ A new fixed option Epic is also added. A powerful item that supports the previously neglected equipment theme is expected to appear. On the other hand, custom epics are not newly added, but instead, existing custom epic equipment appears with a higher probability.\n\n+ The entry system uses a system similar to the existing advanced dungeon, which allows you to enter a certain number of times per week rather than an admission ticket. Can enter as party. Solo mode available. Once a week per character.\n+ The difficulty level (requires 33,043 fames) is not much higher than that of the existing dungeons, but will consist around Meister's Laboratory expert and master level.\n\n* Stormwrath:\n+ Instead of a fixed number of entries per week, this dungeon consumes no play points, has good fatigue efficiency, and has a higher level of equipment options than other dungeons in the same class. The existing dungeon resources will be recycled as an 'intermediate dungeon', which means between a normal dungeon and an advanced dungeon.\n+ It consists of two difficulty levels of 12,000 and 25,000 fames, so it is a great help in advancing to advanced dungeons.\n\n* Dungeon & Life:\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }+ It is a place where you can take a breather from DFO, the traditional battlefield that grows villages by acquiring materials and building buildings through activities such as gathering, fishing, farming, and harvesting through Dungeon & Life. It will be updated on July 7th.\n+ Among them, you can also create consumables that help in battle. You can also play new content along with new consumables such as potions that restore allies or potions that cause status ailments.\n\n* Advance Dungeon Improvements:\n+ Advanced dungeon admission tickets are reorganized so that they can be purchased with Golden Beryl. Also, if you clear the advanced dungeon, there is a 100% chance to get a certain amount of Flawless Golden Beryl. An advanced dungeon card book will also be added so that you can continue to obtain financial benefits when playing advanced dungeons.\n\n* Improvement of Training Room:\n+ Completely revamp the training room, which is one way to measure damage. The type of monster and the battle situation can be created as an actual level 110 dungeon environment.\n+ The ability to retain the original enchantment, material, and equipment option level even if the equipment is replaced in the training room allows you to experience firsthand how powerful it will be in practice when new equipment is acquired\n\n* Neutralization System renewal, Golden Beryl sale Decisive\/Source Weapon adjustment also carried out in this date.\n* More improvement carried out on July 21th\n\n\n\nAugust\/September* Character Renewal & Balancing on August 4th. Bakal Raid Part 1 (weekly dungeon) on August 25th. Bakal Raid Part 2 (actual raid) on September 22nd\n* Bakal Raid, scheduled to be updated in August, will be added in two installments.\n+ Normal difficulty, 'Mechanical Revolution: Open War', can be challenged by 1 to 4 players, and is designed to be cleared more easily by adventurers who are difficult to challenge advanced difficulty or have difficulty in raid structure.\n+ The advanced difficulty, 'Mechanical Revolution: Bakal Raid' is a raid that deals with Bakal in earnest, and 12 people will challenge it together.\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }* Main reward:\u00a04 new weapons, 5 types of fusion armor, and 11 types of fixed optional epic equipment (one for each part) will be introduced. Convergence equipment can be acquired regardless of difficulty, so it will faithfully serve as a cornerstone for challenging advanced levels of difficulty.\n\n\nOctober(Advanced Dungeon Expansion, 16:9 widescreen, PVP season 8)* Advanced Dungeon Expansion:\n+ It is scheduled to be updated around October, and at that point, the equipment level is already high and the reason to return is lost. If you use an additional Lion Core to the existing Master Difficulty Ticket, it will be changed to an admission ticket with 4 enhancement options.\n+ Two reward enhancement effects, one character enhancement effect, and one monster enhancement effect are added, and of course, among the reward enhancement effects, there is a function that allows the equipment option level to appear at a higher level.\n\n* 16:9 Widescreen:\n+ Wide mode is officially supported, providing a wider screen that can be enjoyed in a PC environment. You can see a more detailed and majestic village, and even in the dungeon, colorful patterns and various elements of monsters that were not previously hidden or invisible appear, allowing you to experience a more lively dungeon.\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }* PVP Season 8:\n+ Introduces a system that can reverse the battle pattern by applying a powerful buff to the character when it enters below a certain HP. In addition, most of the skills that were not available for existing characters are unlocked, and blades and assaults are added as new characters.\n\n\nNovemberCharacter Renewal \/ Balance, \u00a0Archmage's Dimensional Corridor* Archmage's Dimensional Corridor:\n+ It is a content in which a group of adventurers who were traveling through the dimension after the battle with Bakal arrive at a place called the \"Library of Memory\", peering into their memories and passing through trials.\n+ Like Ispins, this is the second Legion dungeon with weekly entry counts. It appears on a lower difficulty level than the raid, and for users who have not yet entered the raid, it is possible to raise the equipment level, and for users who have already entered, it is being conceived as content that will help supply and demand goods.\n\n\n\nDecember(Level 1~100 Scenarios Renewal)* Whenever the maximum level is expanded, the story of Dungeon & Fighter is rearranged in such a way that it is added to the existing story. Even after reaching the highest level, the equipment and materials used are reorganized so that they can be obtained from level 1 instead of level 100, and the overall story breathing is also uniformly rearranged.\n\n\nOther Changes* Missions and Play Points:\n+ To reduce fatigue in general dungeons, the efficiency of limited missions will be greatly increased to reduce fatigue. Play points are also earned through missions rather than by consuming fatigue in regular dungeons. It allows you to acquire play points that were previously earned when you exhausted your fatigue in a day just by performing a mission.\n+ It solves the phenomenon that only specific dungeons run by allowing unique Epics obtained from general dungeons to be randomly dropped in advanced dungeons as well as from specific named\/bosses. In the case of Heroes Mode, we plan to reduce the HP increase for each difficulty level so that you can experience the feeling of becoming stronger.\n* Meister's Lab:\n+ Change the position to a dungeon that can be cleared more easily and has a good reward. Overall, the HP was lowered by 10% and the 12 o'clock room where I felt all kinds of negative experiences called 'Pork Cutlet Hammer', 'Identitate' dramatically reduces HP by about 80% so that I can pass easily.\n\n* Character Retouching:\n+ Seem like they're bringing the Dnf Mobile version to PC?\n\n* Custom Legendaries Improvement:\n+ Custom Legendaries will get an option reroll system, options can be rerolled a limited number of times. Reroll count will reset upon being resealed\n\n\n\nQ&A\u00a0* Should buffers farm multiple sets for buffing & damage after the revamp?\n+ No, they\u2019ll make sure the class & gears balancing will prevent this.\n\n* Will dungeon & life consumables be tradable?\n+ Yes they will be tradable.\n\n* +14 reinforce & +12 amp for clears kek.\n+ No, Bakal raid will never be balanced around amps\n\n* Farming custom epics is too hard.\n+ I agree, we\u2019ll eventually add more sources to farm it. If necessary we\u2019ll also consider and add new systems for it. Also they have no plans of adding new custom epics.\n\n* PVP arena too small.\n+ With 16:9 widescreen update they\u2019ll improve PVP visuals as well.\n\n* Male Slayer \/ Female Fighter new sprites when (DFO mobile sprites)\n+ They\u2019re working on it. There are a crapton of sprites so it\u2019s taking some effort, but they are working hard. Very hard. Probably next year. In case anyone asks: no it won\u2019t be some paid thing, it\u2019ll be an actual, free update.\n\n\nReferencesGameChosun  \nhalfmango's Summary  \n\n\n","553":"\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting Room\nozma\\_ready\\_01.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (July 12th).\n\nContent* LEVEL 110 CAP is here. All information can be found in this\u00a0Level 110 Expansion\u00a0category.\n* IMPORTANT: Mileage RESET\n\nEvents* KDnF version of 110 cap events\n* The Next Attendance! - Log in daily to get rewards, cumulative rewards here.\n* Level 100 Warmup!\n+ Leveling up event to help with new players.

Since it's year of the Tiger, you get rewards related to that.\n+ KDnF version\u00a0event here.\n\n* DnF Duel Tournament - Just for DFO community\n+ This will be held for the Steam version of the game. Application open from July 12th to July 26th\n+ For viewers of the event, they will set up raffle to give out Steam code for the game (not sure how many). For contestants, you will get the limited rewards from back when you pre-order the game.\n\nSales* Hyperdimension Arad Package\u00a0(KDnF version here) along with Hyperdimension Pass\n* Mileage shop will be updated. Event\u00a0emblem selective box monthly sale using gold\n* Danji Pot system with new animation (Introduced by YJ, DFO Sale Designer)\n+ This is the system that will be replacing Lost Treasure. It is here to make it more friendly to luckly and unlucky players, and the main goal is to make sure there's a minimum return safeguard.\n+ Skeleton key will no longer available to purchase. Your existing keys will NOT expire, and you can convert them to Danji pot in Seria's room at conversion rate of 3 key to 1 pot. The reason being it takes 3 key to open 1 LT, where you only need 1 pot to open each pot. These Danji pot can be dropped in dungeon just like Skeleton Key.\n+ Originally with LR, you can only open 1 at the time. Here you can pick to open 1 time or 10 times.\n+ You can also select the Danji level, which relate the chance of the key items. Higher level will require more Danji pots to open (e.g. level 2 need 2 pots, level 3 needs 3 pots)\n+ New Danji Stack system also added. Each open will gain stack, and you get reward depends on your milestone. These stack rewards are NOT just one time. When you max the gauge, it resets and you can get rewards all over again. These stack rewards are TRADABLE. These stack rewards are seasonal and will be changed after a certain period (Some simple math here, 942 stacks will need 74,418 Cera, which is about $745 USD).\n\nOthers* N\/A\n\nQ&A* As adventurer\u2019s fame is extremely important next cap, will Neople be readjusting fame for certain items that have released in the past? For example, valhalla dps titles are still one of the best but have extremely low fame, as well as some sader creatures among other things\n+ Please send in tickets or report to CA, and we will handle it.\n\n* I'm a new player and I'm enjoying the game a lot. Fashion is a big deal to me and I love collecting outfits. I am somewhat saddened that some of the older fashion items like coin shop exclusive headgears can't be obtained anymore. Are there any plans to reintroduce these somehow?\n+ These hidden avatars will be included in the Danji pot system\n\n* Will we be getting the nerfed version of 110 cap with some QoL added on day 1, or is it going to be like KR on release?\n+ Yes, it's in our 110 cap update\n+ Personal Note: I'm not sure if this is true, Tigger probably meant \"soon\". Because (1) the required fame for Noblesse Code Master is\u00a029,361\u00a0in the promotion video, whereas KDnF QoL patch is\u00a023,788. (2) The mission UI is this\u00a0instead of QoL version.\n\n\n\n","556":"\n\n* This is a very simple event. You do your mission in game and collect coin so you can apply for lottery and win prices. I wish DFOG have this kind of event.\n\nLottery Entry* You can apply for an unlimited number of times each week, and the more you apply, the higher your chance of winning.\n+ For example, if you want the package, each application costs 200 coins, and you can apply 125 times, the more you apply, the higher change you can win it.\n+ Only gaming PCs can win only once during the entire event period.\n\nMissions* Blow is the list of repeatable missions and their rewards:\n+ Log in once a day (based on Seria room) - 30 coins\n+ Play the game (60 minutes) - 3 coins\n+ Clear optimal level dungeon (5 times) - 3 coins\n+ Advanced Dungeon Clear (1 time) - 30 coins\n+ Complete Daily Missions (4 times) - 10 coins\n+ Obtain Flawless Golden Beryl in advanced dungeons (40 counts) - 25 coins\n\n* And here is the list of weekly missions and their wards\n+ Clear the Storm's Wrath(5 times) - 100 coins\n+ Legion\/Raid Clear (3 times) - 3 coins\n\nLottery Items  \n  \nReferencesEvent Page  \nReward Page\n\n","557":"\n\n* Japan finally released their anniversary contents and sale.\n* Here I'll go over their events and what can you get from it.\n\nTable of Contents* Event\n+ Epic Road\n+ Airship Senki\n+ 15th Anniversary Special Gift\n+ 15th Anniversary Shop\n\n* Voyager Treasure Chest\n* Gamepad Controller\n* References\n\n\nEpic Road* Straight off the bat they give you 500 Time's Guide Stone.

The amount of EXP\u00a0 it gives depends on the level range.\n\n* Corridor Dungeon:\n+ This dungeon is similar to Dimension dungeon. It still drop\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and has higher chance of dropping epic mythic than regular Guide of Wisdom.\n+ The different is that it will consume 8 FP per run and require 27 Time's Guide Stone to enter.\n+ This dungeon has daily entry limit of 50 runs.\n\n\n\nAirship Senki* This is a very interesting event, it looks just like the\u00a0Arcade Fighter Online event DFOG are having right now, but instead of growing your village, you're growing a harbor.\n\n* You can trade goods like berries and wine. You can even buy, sell, upgrade your ship too.\n\n* Unlike\u00a0Arcade Fighter Online where you send adventures and they automatically go, here you need to actually control your ship with arrow key to explore the seven sea.\n\n* There will be object on the map that your ship can interact with like monsters, treasure chests, coin bags, etc. Here's a quick google translate.\n\n* You can complete daily mission to get event mat called \"Trade Certificate\".\n* Here's the list of accumulated mission.

These drop from doing optimal dungeons. You can get 60 coins per day. Below is the coin shop. The big items are the Selective Exile Mountain talisman box and 2 Fearsome Eyes.\n\n* The Firework looks like this\n\n  \n  \n\n\nVoyager Treasure Chest* This is a sale package. Think of this like the Lost Treasure 2.0 and you have the option of buying 1 box, 10 boxes, or 30 boxes pack.\n* Pretty simple, you can open the boxes one by one, or you can open 10 at the time.\n\n* When opening these boxes, you can get a small chance of getting an Amplification Box\u00a0. If you're unlucky, no worries, the gauge at the bottom will fill up as you opening boxes. When the gauge hit 100%, they give you the\u00a0\u00a0on your next box. This box has +10 ~ +12 Amp Tickets at various percent success rate (from 10% to 90%).\n\n* Please go to their official website\u00a0for the complete list of all available items in the RNG pool. Some of the most notable items are +13 Reinforce Ticket, +12 Amp Ticket, Epic Transfer Stone, and Rare Clone Avatar Set Box.\n* One of the items in this RNG pool is Voyage Coin . So if you're unlucky, at least you can rack up these Voyage Coins and buy the following item from the Coin shop. Pretty nice, you can get 2 Mythic Reroll Pot and 1 Epic Transfer Stone.\n\n* Here's the Buy-More-Win-More part, when you buy the 30-box pack, you get 1 Adventure Coin\u00a0\u00a0as bonus. And you can use this coin to buy the following. Bruh, Mythic Transfer Stone for 8 Adventure Coins.\n  \n\n\nGamepad Controller* They updated their internal controller interface. Bruh, it looks promising. It definitely doesn't match the complexity and functionality as third party program like xpadder. But if DFOG ever get it, I'll definitely try it.\n\n* Pros:\n+ Pre-built in, no need for 3rd party program like xpadder.\n+ It has basic options like creature skill, auction hall, skill window, main menu, etc.\n+ You can save up to 4 profiles.\n+ EasyDash option, you can dash with just ONE button (no need to double tap arrow).\n\n* Cons:\n+ Look like you can only register 7 skill keys at the time. But at least they include option where you can swap between row.\n  \n  \n\n\nReferenceshttps:\/\/arad.nexon.co.jp\/news\/update\\_view.aspx?no=12334\u00a0\n\n","558":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2452\/From-Zero-to-Sirocco?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","559":"\n\n* This update adds a new dungeon to the Valley of Fallen Souls area called Grave Tower.

I'm sure many people will grad Sirocco with these changes. I'll combining some of my duplicate pieces and hopefully I'll get something good. Good Luck!\n\n* Honey Time\n+ The daily 30 FP pot is very nice. The 20hr Time's Guide Stone box (200) is also nice.\n\n* From Zero to Sirocco!\n+ Not too bad for getting more end game materials.\n+ I suppose doing Guide Mode would work? The event page didn't mention.\n+ This is a 5-weeks event, and you can get up to 1,050 fragments for level 100 epic.

From a\u00a0small sample\u00a0run, looks like you can get about 100 of each Powerful Energy per 20 runs regardless of dungeon and difficulty. I'll run some numbers when we have this update in DFOG.\n\n* New Shop Option\n+ From Jun's Shop, you can buy 30\u00a0\u00a0with 80 \u00a0(unlimited purchases).

So in the beginning,\u00a0New Player! Start Here\u00a0page was created as an index page to quickly guide players through the game.\n* Looking back, although this page is useful, I thought it's a bit barebone. So I want to expand it to the next level through the inspiration of choco's blog.\n* When you look this blog page, it includes the most basic information about DFO for new players. Things like how to navigate UI, what are cubes, how to use auction hall, how to trade with other players, etc. So I want to make a page just like it and this page would eventually be where new players can go to to learn about the game.\n* This project will be called \"DFOlmanac\" which is a combination of DFO and Almanac (I thought it's a clever name).\n* What the heck is an Almanac? it's basically a guide for farmer that has lots of information to help them decide what and when to plant for the year. It has information like weather, moon phase, etc. So basically DFOlmanac will be a place that contain DFO most basic information to help you progress through the game. You get the idea.\n* The plan: When I have free time, I'll write simple and basic posts about the game. These posts will have [DFOlmanac] in the title and the \"Newbie Friendly\" tag. They will then be organized and indexed so new players can find everything on one page.

Hovering the mouse over it will tell you how many point you have left.\n\n* Fatigue points determine how much you can play that particular character. Generally speaking each dungeon room will cost 1 FP. For example, if a dungeon has 4 rooms, it will cost you 4 FP to clear. When you're out of FP, you can no longer enter dungeon for that day. FP will reset each day.\n* Some exceptions:\n+ With level 100 cap, some dungeons will cost a fix amount of FP regardless of how many room you clear. E.g. Ghent Palace, Basement of Pain, Black Shrine, etc.\n+ Raid dungeons will not cost any FP. E.g. Fiend War, Prey, Sirocco Raids.\n+ Some dungeons don't require any FP at all to enter. E.g. Valley of Fallen Souls area.\n\nGet More FP* The biggest way to increase FP per character is to purchase Neo Premium Contract. It's located under \"Premiums\" tab. This contact will increase your default 156 FP to 272 FP, which is a huge boost. The best part is that this increase is for every character in the account.\n* For a 30 days contract, it will cost you about $10.\n* NOTE: If you get the contract, you will have an option to turn on \"FP Express\", which burn FP twice as fast but give you twice as much EXP. Do NOT turn this on. The majority of your EXP for leveling is from completing quests, which this function does not increase. So the more FP you have, the more quests you can complete, the faster you can level up.\n\n* Beside contract, another way to increase FP is through FP pot. This generic point can be crafted through Alchemy profession. Most people buy them from Auction Hall.\n* You can only use 1 pot per character per day. Each pot will recover 30 FP.\n\n* Sometimes Neople releases packages what have FP pot as bonus as well. So watch out for those.\n\n  \nThe Problem With FP* The biggest problem is that Fatigue Point hinder new players from playing more on their first day. DFO only allows you to create 2 characters per day. For a 156 FP bar, it will take about 1 hour or so to burn through.\n* So without any FP pot, on the 1st day, new players probably can only play about 2-3 hours.\n* If you're a new player reading this post. Please don't let this kill your game experience. I can assure you that when you get to max level and closer to end game, FP won't be a problem at all. This game highly encourage you to play multiple characters. The more characters you have, the better funneling you can do.\n* Just look at the first page of my character screen, I barely have time in the day to play all of them.\n\n\n","565":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/pg\/qlipha2021?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","566":"\n\n* This small patch only include a few small things. The developer has noticed that some end game contents have cube gimmicks that prevent you from using skills that consume clear cubes. Therefore they add a small QoL to the following buff skills so they will no longer consume clear cubes.\n+ Male Nen Master:\u00a0\u00a0Tiger Flash\n+ Female Nen Master:\u00a0\u00a0Tiger Flash: Nen Creature of Light\n+ Elementalist:\u00a0\u00a0Transcendence Rune\n+ Kunoichi:\u00a0\u00a0Ninpou: Shadow Clone\n\n* Sharman got a small QoL for\u00a0\u00a0One Hundred Eight Beads.\u00a0The skill key input time required to cast the wide-area explosion version is reduced.\n\n* Now to the good part. As we all know from Ozma Raid, the\u00a0Rationale System\u00a0(aka Sanity) is kind of a pain in the rear because of the counter gimmicks. So they have changed it so that when your sanity gauge hit zero, instead of counter hit the monster, you just need to match the orb colors. The order of color doesn't matter, as long as you can clear all 4 colors, you're good.\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }* HOWEVER, looks like when you're facing Ozma, the pattern where the entire party needs to do cumulative counter attacks to force 10-sec groggy, you still need to counter.\n\nReferencesKDnF Live Server Patch  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZCn-snZW--E  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oMRyiklIyz4  \n\n\n","567":"\n\n* This small patch come with a new package and a small event that lead to Ozma raid in Japan.\n* This is interesting because Japan doesn't have Dark Knight and Creator 3a yet, and they already release pre-ozma event.\n\nLook Avatar* Unlike DFOG, these look avatar have their own stat.

Here I will explain how it works in simple terms.\n\nWhy Retexture?* There are 5 armor types in this game: Cloth, Leather, Light, Heavy, and Plate. Why can't we just use whatever drop? It's because classes have their own Armor mastery, which gives extra stats when you wear appropriate type.\n* Armor Master is a passive skill that learned when you start to change to your subclass. In the example below, when Male Gunner become Male Ranger, he gets Leather Armor Mastery.\n* So when a Male Ranger equip a leather armor, he gets extra stats. Below is the description of the passive. In total, by wearing all 5 leather armors, you can get up to 316 Strength and 15% Critical Chance. Simple damage gains for not a lot of work.\n\nHow to Retexture?* First, walk to NPC Roger Levin in West Coast, talk to him and select \"Retexture\". NPC Strawberry Nose Della in Black Market can also retexture as well.\n\n* After that, simply put in the armor piece you want to retexture, select the type of armor you want to convert into (it will ask you for some materials), then click \"Retexture\". That's it, super easy.\n\n* Each retexture, depending on the armor type, will ask for 500,000 gold, 1 legendary soul, and 80 Superior material (leather, cloth, bone, stone, or iron). These leather, cloth, bone, stone, or iron materials can be easily found through dungeon runs. Pretty much all mobs can drop these.\n\n\n\n\n","569":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2501\/Destruction-and-Chaos?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","570":"\n\n* This patch, Japan made a dual release of Ozma Raid along with the rest of the 3rd Awakening.\n* Here I summarize the patch along with its events.\n\nPatch Summary* Ozma raid is released along with everything that go with it.

Here I will simplify the effect of each set along with their pros and cons to help you pick which set is best for you.\n* I don't play Sader and Aeterna much, so this post will mostly cater to DPS and Synergies. But for your reference, I'll put the stat summary and comments for Sader and Aeterna at the end.\n\nTable of Contents* Why Read This?\n* For DPS \/ Syn\n+ Tiamat Set Summary\n+ Astaros Set Summary\n+ Rosenbach Set Summary\n+ Berias Set Summary\n+ Redmayne Set Summary\n+ Combination Example\n+ Summary\n\n* For Saders\n* For Aeterna\n* References\n\n\n\nWhy Read This?* Well, with Ozma raid, you get 5 sets, each contain 5 pieces, to fuse with your Shoulder, Shoe, Belt, Necklace, and Magic Stone.\n* On top of that, each Ozma set has set option of 2-set, 3-set, or 5-set. So as you can see, just like level 100 epics, you can mix match multiple Ozma set to your liking.\n* AND on top of that, Ozma has reroll option where you can add unwanted pieces and filter out what you want. So eventually, with enough effort, you can get any Ozma pieces you want.\n* NOTE: Your Ozma reroll will reset if you collect the item. So you\u2019ll have to do it all in one go to get the exact piece you want.\n\n* NOTE: There are some RNG involved with Ozma Epic. Each Ozma piece will have a grade (Blue, Purple, Yellow). Each grade will provide different \"Special Option\" stat and there's no way to reset them (you will have to hope for another dup with higher stat).\n+ For example, Tiamat Shoulder that provide \"Level 45 skill consume (9 \/ 7 \/ 5%) HP\". That means if you get a blue version, the skill will consume 5%, purple version consumes 7%, and so on.\n\n\nFor DPS \/ Syn\n\nTiamat Set Summary* Pros: This set has\u00a01% higher modifier from the \"Simple Option\" than other set. Especially with the Shoes piece, it has 2% higher total modifier (1% higher Additional Attack and 1% higher Bonus Damage).\n* Cons: Every time you cast a certain skill, you lose 5-9% HP. The cooldown is 10% but this can be a problem especially during longer fight or when you have lots of CDR gears.\n* Good News: At 3-set option, the HP reduced is cut down by\u00a05%. So now instead of losing 9\/7\/5%, you will lose 4\/2\/0% instead, which is great.\n* Overall:\n+ If you want to get this set, the Shoes is a must.\n+ Try to get 3-set option to get the reduced penalty.\n+ Mix with other set that have utility.\n\n\nAstaros Set Summary* Pros: Huge skill level increases the more pieces you wear.\n+ With the 2-set option, you can type \"Past\" to activate that dimension. Think about if you get 2-piece of yellow version, you can activate +2 levels to skill 70, 75, and 80. Which is a huge damage increase.\n\n* Cons: Highly RNG and you don't always get the version of the skill range you want.\n* Overall: This set is very good if you know what skill range you want to activate.\n+ It's also hard to make a recommendation because every class has different skills, but generally higher level skill like 70 75 and 80 do a lot more damage.\n+ If you want to use this, I would get at either 2-set or 3-set option (maybe 3 Tiamat\u00a0piece and 2 Astaros piece)\n\n\n\nRosenbach Set Summary* Pros: Great utility set that give you a shield (20% of Max HP) and give you various buff if you get hit with the active shield. The 2-set option is great, increasing 1% HP\/MP every 1 second.\n* Cons: Nothing really.\n* Overall: Best with 2-set utility option. Highly recommend the belt for movement speed.\n\n\nBerias Set Summary* The pieces give you a soul (Max Stacks: 1, Soul perish after 5 hits, Hit Cooldown: 2 seconds, Soul Respawn Cooltime: 20 seconds) on top of your character that give you buff.\n* Pros: Great utility set like\u00a0Rosenbach. The buff effects are great.\n+ With 2-set option, you can increase hit limit to 6 and reduced Soul Respawn cooltime to 15 second.\n+ Unlike Rosenback set where you have to get it to get buff, this set gives you buff right at the start.\n\n* Cons: The set options fall short after 2-set.\n* Overall: Good utility options. The Necklace is the only Ozma piece that give both Attack and Casting Speed.\n\n\n\nRedmayne Set Summary* Pros: Decrease skill cooldown by 10%, which can go great with other CDR strategy like Mind Stim Potion and Sirocco's Assassin Set.\n* Cons: Decrease your max HP\/MP by a huge amount.\n* Overall: Great set.\u00a0I would check how much CDR you have and weight your risk\/benefit from there.\n\n\n\nCombination Example* 3\u00a0Tiamat (higher modifier) + 2\u00a0Redmayne (more CDR):\n+ Remember to get Tiamat Shoe for the 2% higher modifier.\n+ This combination is good if you already have epic set that already give utility (e.g. Crossroad set)\n\n* 3 Tiamat (higher modifier) + 2 Rosenbach or 2 Berias:\n+ If you don't have a lot of utility, this is a good combination.\n+ If you don't care about the 3-set\u00a0Tiamat that reduces the HP penalty, you can replace it with\u00a0Berias belt to make up for those HP lost.\n\n\nSummary for DPS\/Syn* Tiamat Set - Higher overall modifier, but comes with HP penalty.\n* Astaros Set - Increase skill level at a rotation, comes with no penalty.\n* Rosenbach Set - Create HP shield, gives buffs when you got hit.\n* Berias Set - Give buffs right off the bat, and wears off after certain number of hit.\n* Redmayne Set - Reduce skill cooldown, but comes with reduce max HP\/MP penalty.\n\n\n\nFor SadersTiamat Set Summary* Definitely has the strongest buff power, but doesn't provide any additional benefit through healing, resurrections, etc. (perhaps you can use this a swap set)\n* If you're playing Enchantress, note that wearing all 5-piece will reduce Black Forest Barrier from 5 sec to 3 sec.\nAstaros Set Summary* Buff power is quite low compared to other. It offers no special benefit or penalty.\nRosenbach Set Summary* Overall great balanced set. Buff power is not the highest, but provides huge additional benefits through special option. I fell like most sader would go with this set.\n* Note that the barrier her is 5% of Max HP as compared to 20% for DPS\/Syn.\nBerias Set Summary* This set only increase stat through passive skills, and doesn't add any buff power to level 30 and 50 skills.\nRedmayne Set Summary* Overall about the same power as Astaros set, although comes will penalty in healing skills.\n\n\nFor AeternaTiamat Set Summary* For simple option, you get total of 1,550 stat increase right of the bat.\n* In addition to special option (assuming you cast all the required skills to proc the effect), you get another 1,250 stat, for a total whopping 2,800 stat. This set by far will provide the most stat.\n\nAstaros Set Summary* For simple option (just like Tiamat), you get total of 1,550 stat increase.\n* The special option is RNG though, you get additional 375, 625, or 875 stat for a total of 1,925 or 2,175 or 2,425 stat.\n* As you can see, the total buff is not as strong as Tiamat and has RNG involved.\n\nRosenbach Set Summary* For simple option (just like Tiamat), you get total of 1,550 stat increase.\n* For special option, it's pretty bad. Here you only get additional 100 stat. So I don't recommend using this set at all.\n\nBerias Set Summary* For simple option (just like Tiamat), you get total of 1,550 stat increase.\n* This set definitely gives you huge attack movement casting speed. But again, it only provide additional 100 stat through special option.\nRedmayne Set Summary* Unlike other sets, this one gives you 1,675 stat through simple option.\n* It gives you the highest simple option stat, but fails to provide any additional stat through special option.\n\nSummary for Aeterna* Tiamat Set - Higher overall party effects, but comes with HP penalty.\n* Astaros Set - 2nd highest party effects, but comes with RNG.\n* Rosenbach Set - Bad party effect, but high survival with the shield.\n* Berias Set - Bad party effect, but gives huge attack movement casting speed.\n* Redmayne Set - 3rd highest party effects, gives total 900 px party effect, but comes with HP\/MP penalty.\n\n\nReferencesNamu Wiki  \nNaver -\u00a0Let's Fuse Ozma Epics  \nDunpa Cast -\u00a0Ozma Equip Summary  \nChangelog* 1\/2\/2022:\n+ Changed icons for Magic Stone slots for Rosenbach and\u00a0Redmayne pictures.\n\n* 12\/17\/2021:\n+ Added clarification on Ozma reroll system\n\n* 11\/15\/2021:\n+ Edited images to match DFOG version\n+ Added Sader comments\n+ Added Aeterna options and recommendation\n\n\n","572":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2517\/The-End-of-Neo-Awakenings?page=1  \n  \n\n\n","573":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2516\/Auto-terna?page=1  \n  \n\n\n","574":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2521\/Master-of-Ozma-Raid?page=1  \n  \n  \n\n\n","575":"\n\n* DFO ExStream is a traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (Nov. 9th).\n* The user\u00a0u\/Princess\\_Everdeen\u00a0has stepped down from writing confirmation\u00a0for us.

And with the Farming QoL Improvement coming up on the horizon, there're now even more ways to funnel your resources.\n* Do you want to learn how to funnel? In this article, I will show you the many ways to can gear up your alt from Zero to Hero.\n\nGeneral Information* Before we start, this\u00a0Equipment Farming Improvements\u00a0will be your main farming method. Basically all the character bound materials in level 100 cap will now have their account-bound version. As you can see, the more alts you have, the faster you can gear up another character..\n\nWeapon* Grave Tower is an option if you have highly geared characters. You can register up to 6 characters per week to gather Old Golden Coins, then use them to buy the weapon type of your choice. Since there are 2 level 100 weapon for each type, here you have 50% chance of getting the weapon you want.\n* Hard Oculus is another option. You can get this Random Weapon box once per month per character, and it's account-bound. The sad thing is that pot is randomized based on the base class (slayer, gunner, mage, etc.)\n\n* Pit of Incarceration 3,4,5 also give mat to buy weapon pot. Unfortunately, the pool for this pot is very big. For example, if you're female fighter, it will give you a random weapon among all the fighter weapon type.\n\n* If you need to refine the weapon,\u00a0Powerful Energy Improvements\u00a0added account-bound version to fit your needs.\n+ Clearing Roschest legendary dungeon will give you account-bound Refined Powerful Energy\u00a0.\n+ You can also buy\u00a0\u00a0through NPC Jun using\u00a0\u00a0and buy from Raid shop using\u00a0.\n\nEquipment* With the improvement patch, you can now upgrade level 100 legendary to pre-selected level 100 epic sets (Mother Nature, Elementalist, Synchro sets). Legendary to Epic needs 2,000\u00a0\u00a0and 100\u00a0.\n+ For 3+3 dungeon,\u00a0\u00a0reward multiplied by 1.5 times. 50% of\u00a0\u00a0will be given out as\u00a0. The cost of legendary equipment is reduced to 600\u00a0\u00a0each. Looking at the\u00a0data from my 3+3 runs, each character can get you 60\u00a0. So doing 3+3 total\u00a010 times\u00a0will give you enough account-bound mat to buy 1 legendary slot.\n+ For 2+2 dungeon,\u00a0\u00a0reward multiplied by 2 times. 50% of\u00a0\u00a0will be given out as\u00a0. Looking at the data from by 2+2 run, each character can get you about 61\u00a0. So doing 2+2 total 361 times\u00a0will get you enough account-bound mat to upgrade all 11 slots. Also remember that Oculus also give\u00a0. I have 25 characters that can do 2+2, so it will take me like 2 weeks to get this done.\n\n* Random Epic Pots are your friends. They're available from NPC Dorothy and NPC Robato. They are character bound, but the materials needed to buy them comes in account-bound version (\u00a0and\u00a0). So the more 2+2 and Oculus you do, the more you can buy these pots.\n+ From the Sirocco Challenge shop, you can get another random pot per week.\n+ Also, DON'T forget your Oculus Ditto\u00a0and your random epic pot from Night of Revelation too.\n\n* Recycle unwanted epics\u00a0from all your random pots. The \"Chest of Immateriality\" from Sirocco Challenge shop is a good option. In addition, with\u00a0KDnF's Sirocco Hard mode, you can buy 2 Chests per character per week with\u00a0.\n\n* Last option for your desperate needs. If there's an epic piece you really need to complete the set-up, beside transferring the piece from another character, you can buy the epic fragments from Sirocco and Ozma raid shop. Each of these boxes will give you 50 fragments.\n\n  \nMythic* Really the only way you can funnel this is through transferring from another character. Mythic\u00a0 can be dissembled and will give 1 Light of Wisdom\n* Transferring Mythic will need the following materials. You will need 630 Elemental Crystal for earring slot instead of 420.\n  \n* Want to reroll specific Mythic line? Sirocco Hard mode got chu. You can buy up to 2 mythic kaleido boxes per character per week.\n\nBlack Purgatory Mods* Reward Improvements\u00a0were added so you can buy Ore of Despair Box\u00a0\u00a0from auction hall if needed. They also added Fearsome Eye box\u00a0\u00a0that let you get 2 eyes per week guaranteed.\n* Mods Improvements\u00a0were added so you can inherit the mod to another piece of the same slot and change the type of mods too. As you can see, the more BP daily \/ weekly you do, the more Ore you can funnel.\n  \nSirocco Pieces* The Sirocco weapon is easy, you can just funnel 220 petals for that.\n* The \"Liberated Subconscious Pot\" is your friend. The more Sirocco you do, the more Account-bound\u00a0\u00a0you can funnel.\n* The \"Chest of Circulation\" will allow you to recycle unwanted Sirocco pieces.\n* If you still can't get the piece you want, Ozma raid has Selective Sirocco box you can buy for the cost of 30 Saturated Grudge Crystal. Beside doing Ozma raid, you can get this crystal through\u00a0Sirocco Hard Mode\u00a0(up to 2 crystals per week per character). Really between this box and Sirocco Ditto, you will grad in no time.\n\n  \nOzma Pieces* This part is very straight forward, the only way you can get the pieces you want is to open the \"Sleeping Terror Pot\", then use the \"Holy Grail of Faith\" system to filter out the pieces.\n  \nTalismans and Runes* Forget about the RNG with this system. The\u00a0Runes \/ Talisman Improvements\u00a0made it so that you can purchase unlimited \"Capella Talisman Selective Box\"\n* As you can see, doing enough Exile Mountain will get you enough account-bound\u00a0\u00a0to get any talismans and runes you want.\n  \nSwap Set* Operation Hope\u00a0changes make it super easy.\u00a0\u00a0will be given out as\u00a0, so farm this as much as your heart desires.\n* S Recipe will have 100% success rate, and Abyss Fragment's purchase limit removed.\n\nWooHoo* There you have it. That's pretty much all the different ways I can think of to help you funnel and gear up your alts. As always, if I'm missing any other ways, let me know!\n\n\n","578":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2542\/Lucky-Black-Friday?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","579":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2515\/Spectre-Preview?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","580":"\n\n\n\n\n\nDungeon\nmirkwood.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10;

In Global version, this is called Arcade Legend Online.\n* Here I will summarize the event, provide some tips and tricks, along with material tables and quest guide. Curtesy of wonderful KDnF Casters.\n\nTable of Contents* General Information\n* Reward Shop\n* Tips and Tricks\n* Material Tables\n+ Building Upgrade\n+ Linus Weapon Shop\n+ Hill's Armor Shop\n+ Gina's Accessory Shop\n+ Danjin's Special Equipment Shop\n+ Loton's Material Shop\n+ Canna's Crafting Shop\n+ Hekate's Souvenir Shop\n+ Regional Boss Drop Equipment\n+ Secretive Tree - Weapon Combination\n+ Sharan's Armor Combination Shop\n+ Ferris' Special Equipment - Combination Shop\n+ Secret Moonlight Tavern - Special Material Combination\n\n* Quest Guide\n* References\n\n\n\nGeneral Information* This sequel uses the same concept as the original. In this edition, instead of raising multiple characters and have no control over where they go, you now control the character.\n* In a nutshell, you collect materials, craft stuff, then clear higher level dungeon. Ya know, basically like every MMORPG out there.\n\n* (1) This is your character info bar. It include info like gold, HP, potion, and Fatigue points.\n* (2) Alert center. It basically notify you when something new is available\n* (3) Mini-map\n* (4) Your character. You can use the arrow keys to walk around.\n* (5) Tool bar, include things like character info, inventory, achievement, etc.\n\n* This part is very self explanatory. This is basically your character info, where you can see level, equipment, stat, etc.\n* That's basically it, you kill stuff, gather stuff, kill daily boss, unlock more regions. One thing to note is that in this version, you don't really build anything. All the building already placed on your town, so you will need to upgrade them to be able to buy stronger equip.\n\n\n\nReward Shop* The currency is called Bit Fragment, and you can get them through completing daily and achievement within the mini-game.\n* The shop is not bad, some of the notable ones are:\n+ Sirocco Set Box: you select a set and it spits out a random piece of that set.\n+ Selective Level 100 epic equipment box.\n+ Selective Level 100 epic weapon box.\n+ Time's Guide Stone box (100 count): You can buy 2 boxes per week and it's a 6-week event, so basically free 1,200 TSG.\n+ Cosmetic like Face and Weapon avatar\n\n* In the Japanese\u00a0version of the event, they also give you cosmetic\u00a0bubble head, pets and emotes as well.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nTips and Tricks* The goblin attack speed is quite slow, so you can actually use the hit-n-run strategy. From the look of it, doing it horizontally seems to work better.\n* Each region boss appear once per day.\n* The Wooden Club from Souvenir Shop is a good starter weapon. It has 100 attack, which is stronger that the default weapon they give you. It has level 1 requirement so you can just equip right the way.\n\n* Right at the beginning, talk to Seria to complete a series of question. When done she will give you a Cosmic Soul, which you can use to upgrade the\u00a0Souvenir Shop to level 2. Then you can buy \"Faded Emerald Ring\" which adds 435 HP and 15 movement speed (very helpful in early game).\n\n* When you're out of HP, drink from the village pond to recover.\n\n* If you don't want to manually hunt, you can put your character in auto-drive. It will take about 20 minutes to burn through 156 FP bar. If you were doing it manually, each mob kill will cost 3 FP.\n\n* The level 1 Chestplate is another good early game purchase from the Armor Shop. It cost 1,800 gold and has 48 defense.\n\n* Treasure chests are your friend. Each one is 500 gold and the estimated location are as below. The chests (red circles) will reset daily. The Blue Circles and Gray Squares are locations for quests which I'll cover later on.\n\n  \n\n\nMaterial Tables* You can get the following materials from mob drops based on the region levels.\n\n\n\n| Area | Icon | Material Name | Dropped By | Sell Price(Gold) |\n| Grand Flores(Level 1~25) | Starting |  | Goblin Leather | Arcade Goblin | 68 |\n| Midway |  | Kinoll's Lightning

Here I'll summarize what is needed so you can get the Mythic of your choice.\n\nHow Many Stones* From the Event page, each stone will let you filter out 1 mythic that you don't want. The best part is your selection will be saved when you use the next stone. There 35 Mythic in the game, so in theory you will need 34 stones to get the Mythic of your choice.\n* Is it really possible to get 34 stones? I'm not sure. But from\u00a0this video, he used 34 stones to get the Annunciation Mythic from KDnF Blade events.\n\nHow to Get 34 Stones\n\n* Let's do some math to see if it's possible. Right off the bat, by hitting training level 10, you get 6\u00a0stones. So make sure you farm those event dungeons to level up.\n\n* Next is from leveling to 100. You will get 3 stones (1 from level 95 and 2 from level 100). Now you have 9 stones.\n\n* Next is from Posia's shop, you can get 1 stone every week for 8 weeks. Now you have 17 stones. You will need to get 2,000 Stectre Tokens for those 8 stones. I found that a good way to get those is to dissemble those \"S\" equipment dropped from the event dungeons.\n\n* To get the remaining stones, they have to come from \"Path of the Spectre\" event. From looking at all the path, you can get another 5\u00a0stones. Now you have 22.\n\n* To get the remaining 12 stones, you can get them from buying the repeatable box at the end of the path.\n\n* In order to buy everything from this path without getting the last box, you will need\u00a021,600 RP. Since each repeatable last box cost 2,000 RP, in order to get 12 stones and clear out the whole path, you will need total of 45,600 RP.\nHow to Get RP Points* Once you hit level 100 on Spectre, you can gain RP points from clearing end-game dungeons. Your first source is \"Hall of Experience\" and they can only done once. You can earn total 4,150 RP here.\n\n* The next source is \"Hall of Exploration\" and they can be done respectively. If my math is correct, you can get up to 4,750 RP per week\u00a0 assuming:\n+ You clear all your daily dungeon everyday.\n+ You clear Oculus, Exile, and Black Purgatory 3 times per week.\n+ You clear Prey, Sirocco, and Ozma 2 times per week.\n\n* Since this is an 8-week events, you can get up to\u00a038,000 RP\u00a0totally.\n* So if you complete both hall, you can only get 42,150 RP, which is nowhere close to\u00a045,600 RP to clear out the path and buy all the repeatable stones.\n* To make up for the 3,450 RP short, you can clear daily dungeon repetitively through the \"Hall of Exploration\". I would recommend farming the \"Spectre Event Dungeon\" because they drop epics, talisman, BP mat, etc. Each run gives you 15 RP, so you just need to do 230 runs over the course of 8 weeks to get all the benefit from this event (which is about 5\u00a0runs per day everyday).\n\nWhich Mythic Should I Get* One of DFOG Content Creator has done a video about this topic, you can watch it here. You can also use this\u00a0https:\/\/apps.dfcat.net\/regiondungeon\/ to specifically farm for the epic piece you want.\n\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \nChangelog  \n* 12\/5\/2021: You get 3 extra stones from leveling, the RP calculation has been adjust to reflect these changes.\n\n\n\n","591":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","592":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","593":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","594":"\n\n* As stated in the Exstream confirmation, DFOG will get full Farming Improvement Update. With this patch, Ghent will yield more Token and the cost for Unique gears will be reduced. Here I'll do some quick math to see how much gold you can earn from here.\n\nWhat QoL* Each run will now yield x1.5 times more Token, AND Ghent unique gears (including weapon) will have the cost reduction from 600 to 400 Tokens. Basically you can buy more Weapon to resell. These heavy bulk weapon (e.g. Zan, Cannon) can be sold for almost 30k gold each.\n* If you didn't know, KDnF daily reward count is 6 per day, and DFOG is 20 per day.\n\n  \nQuick Math* Belows are some of the data I have gathered for my previous comparison, using Aiolite price of 4,183 gold. Each of the data row is 20 runs.\n  \n* If Ghent get the QoL Patch:\n+ For 20 runs, your average Token earning will goes from\u00a05,589 \u2192 8,383.5\n+ Which mean you can buy 20.9 weapons to resell, which give you about 625,997 gold.\n+ Add that to your average raw gold earning\u00a0609,727 will give 1,235,723\n\n* Compare that to Stormy Route average 20 runs:\n+ 1,235,723 (Ghent) vs.\u00a0983,771 (Stormy), that's about 25.6% better and Ghent really require no gear to clear\n\nWhat about Roschest* Well, from my data, Roschest gives 1,260,294 gold per 20 runs. Using\u00a016,600 as Time Crystal price.\n* If we get Ghent QoL, 20 runs can give\u00a01,235,723 gold, that's a 1.98% different. Literally Ghent will become the BEST GOLD FARMING\u00a0spot.\n* This would have huge impact on the game's economy for our server. Because why would I gear up 12\/12 to farm Roschest where I can just farm Ghent in Unique gears that I can obtain in like 1 day? I'm sure farming bot would love this.\n* Again, these are just in theory. If we actually get it, I'll definitely run some number.\n\n\n","595":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","596":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","597":"\n\n* DFO ExStream is a traditional live stream from the DFOG developer team where they showcase what contents, event, and sale are coming on the following week.\n* The following are confirmed to be released on the next weekly maintenance (Dec. 7th).\n\nContent* Watcher in the Rift\u00a0(aka Watcher of Crack)\n+ Basically GoW 2.0.\u00a0It is designed so that you can acquire not only the epic\/mythical equipment acquired in the guide of wisdom, but also the sirocco epic equipment.\n+ Clear Watcher to gather Watchful Energy Light then enter Guide of Extinction to get your guarantee epic.\n+ Full KDnF note here.\n\n* Farming Improvement Update\n+ Full QoL update.

Here's a quick summary of potion, how to get them, and which one to use.\n\nImportant* For potions that recover HP and MP, they often share cooldown. So make sure you go to the training center to see which one share cooldown with which one.\n* In the example below, Heavenly HP potion and Canna's Homemade Bread share the same cooldown because they both recover 30% HP.\n\n* However, Canna's Homemade Bread doesn't share cooldown with Adventure Recovery potion even though both restore 30% HP because they have different description.\n\nHow to Get* Buy from Cera Shop, they can be found under \"Item\" tab and \"Dungeon\" sub-tab. While they get the job done, I highly recommend you NOT get potion from here. There're other ways.\n* From Neo Premium Vending Machine, her you use Neo Premium Token to as RNG slot machine. Often time you get lots of good potion. The down side is that these Tokens only drop in dungeons if you have Neo Premium Contract (which cost about $10 USD per month).\n\n* From Arad Adventure system, this is a new mini-game added with Sirocco raid. While doing your adventure dungeons, you can encounter Gabriel's shop where you buy Mystery box from him. At the end of each month, I gather about 100-200 Recover Potions from this method.\n\n* From events, Neople continuously give out free potions using event currency. So watch out for those. Here's an example.\n\n* From Alchemy crafting, which is a profession that dedicate to making potions. DFO Wiki has a good page about this topic.\n\nWhich One to Use* Beside the HP \/ MP potions, there are other ones that give you huge boost. The following are commonly used by veterans in end-game dungeons and raids.\n+ Warlord's Cry Potion: Attack damage +12% for 60 seconds\n+ Mind Stimulant Potion:\u00a0Reduces the cooldown of all skills by 20% for 10 minutes.\n+ Undiluted Strength Potion: Boosts Strength by 175 for 30 minutes\n+ Undiluted Intelligence\u00a0Potion: Boosts Intelligence\u00a0by 175 for 30 minutes\n+ Undiluted Vital Potion:\u00a0Max HP will increase by 1850 for 30 minutes\n+ Undiluted Mana Nostrum: Max MP will increase by 1465 for 30 minutes\n\n* Other non-dungeon potions that often used are:\n+ Reinforcement Proficiency Formula:\u00a0Increases your Reinforcement Success Rate for 30 minutes.\n+ Elixir of Fatigue Recovery:\u00a0Recovers Your Fatigue Level by 30. (You can only use it once per day).\n\n\n","600":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2595\/DFO-Content-Creator-Season-3?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","601":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2593\/Juicy-Craft-Season-2?page=1\n\n","602":"\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n","603":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2592\/Rias-Special-Cube-Laboratory-II?page=1\n\n","604":"\n\n* This huge update adds the new Hell mode dungeon (aka Guide of Wisdom 2.0) and the complete\u00a0Equipment Farming Improvement.\n* Class artworks and details are located in\u00a0Neople official website.\n* Events\n+ HONEY WEEKEND\n+ Juicy Craft - Season 2\n+ Ria's Special Cube Laboratory II\n+ DFO Content Creator - Season 3\n\n* Sales\n+ Arad Pass Season 2\n\nComments* Equipment Farming Improvement\n+ This is really nice WITH one EXCEPTION.

I'm not sure how it will work with Global version, so we'll have to wait to see.\n  \n\n\n5th Male Gunner* This new subclass is called Assault. Definitely looks like a cyborg with tons of technology. Damage type and weapon type are unknown. You can watch the trailer below.\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n\n\nSynergy Class Removal* The director stated that all synergy will receive 8.5% buffs.

There will be some other balance patches in the between as well.\n\n\n\nRevisit from Otherverse Dungeons.* If you didn't know OV dungeons were deleted a while ago along with Chronical gears. And now they will make a come back. In the Festival, they didn't showcase any of it. But in the Chinese Festival, they did release some gameplay. I'm not sure what gear they will give.\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\nMarch 17th, 2022:\u00a0New Level 110 Cap\n\nNew Dungeons* 8 Normal Dungeons and 2 Advanced Dungeons (like Oculus) will be added. Below are some promotion videos.\n+ Saint's War |\u00a0Noblesse Code | Destroyed Castle of the Dead\u00a0| Laboratory of Eternal Flame\n\n* The director stated that leveling \/ base gear farming is too easy and boring, and the gear spectrum is too wide between players (aka newbies vs veterans). Also setting standards on the new and gearless players makes the story boring and meaningless for the rest. So he wants to focus on making the leveling phase part of the content & interesting.\n* Therefore, story dungeons will have\u00a0regular difficulties\u00a0(normal ~ king). Higher difficulty will give more rewards and EXP to level up. Gears will also drop during the story \/ leveling phase. Normal will be doable very easily, but king will require powerful gear such as Ozma's graduate.\n* Hero difficulty\u00a0will make a return as the challenging content for the geared players, including new patterns for mobs. This Hero mode will drop account-bound rewards.\n* Advanced dungeons will haven\u00a0no weekly entry\u00a0limits. Raids weekly entry limit will remains the same. In addition,\u00a0tickets & play point system will be added. This is where you spend FP for the points, use the points to buy the tickets for the advanced dungeons (tradable tickets can also drop). These tickets do not expire on weekly reset. The point is that you don't have to get your weekly homework done on that week. If you're busy, you can still use the tickets the following week.\u00a0Achievements and dungeon missions will be added to motivate playing and make grinding a bit less stressing.\n\n* One of the Advanced dungeon, Noblesse Code, will has a system similar to Squad Mode where you can pick and choose which reward you want to give to which alts.\n* Can be entered with up to 4 characters, solo is fine if you\u2019re strong enough but each char can only get a fixed number of epics so more chars = more pieces. Will have a very high epic drop rate.\n\n\nNew Gears* New gears are added. It's level 110 cap, but gear will be level 105. Gear\u2019s level does not match characters\u2019 max level because they wanted to try something new.\n* He wanted to simplify damage mods. So for DPS, all 6 damage mods (e.g. Smash, Crit Smash, PMI, Str\/Int, All, Bonus) will be merged into \"Damage Increase\" and will be a base option on all gears. For Buffers, all buff options will be merged into a new option called \"Buff Power\" and will be a base option on all gears.\n* He wanted freedom of setups, so the new epic will have no set effects, only single pieces so you can use whatever pieces you want.\n* These new epics will be new other options (e.g. increased CDR rate when enemy is in groggy, etc). Some pieces will have fixed effects, others will have modifiable options. These modifiable options can be changed with mats you get from dungeons.\n* Option growth: New legendaries and epics will have a variety of options that gain EXP and level up.\n\n* Moreover, you can merge duplicates to gain massive gear EXP.\n\n* Ozma pieces and max Black Purgatory rolled Sirocco pieces (including weapons) are also usable for feeding EXP. The required EXP per level will increase exponentially while stat increase per level will decrease, so \u2018maxing out\u2019 won\u2019t be necessary.\n\n* Option transfer: For the pieces with customizable options 1 of the 4 options will be transferable to another piece to replace an option you don\u2019t like. Unsure whether you can just do this for all 4 options at once and finish a piece, but they seem to be implying that you can only do this for 1 option.\n\n* Weapons: There will be 2 different weapons for each kind: 1 focused on damage and 1 focused on skills improvement (similar to Chronicle \/ Talisman shoes). Drop rate for your own weapon will be much higher compared to others.\n* Level 105 Rare\/Unique\/Legendary Equipment:\n+ Rare: Will take over Ghent unique. Fully farmable in 2~3 days.\n+ Unique: 2 different kinds, a damage set similar to 100 legendaries and a set that will be an improved abyssal swap. Will drop very rarely in tradable form.\n+ Legendary: Similar power as the customizable epics but tradable. Designed to be a jackpot tradable gear to feed \/ transfer options to your epics.\n+ Mythic and PoW: Those that are strong in single piece will be usable in place of the same slot 105 pieces for a while. Due to the remaining discrepancies and changes in systems some Mythics will be rebalanced.\n\n* Others:\n+ Inheriting and engraving will stay.\n+ Gear rebalancing can happen more often than before to prevent 'crazy setups'\n+ CDR will cap at 70% for all skills.\n+ In dungeon, gear swapping (e.g. armors, acc and sub) will be restricted.\n+ Dungeon selling: too cheap for too great of a return. Fame will limit dungeon entry (similar to exorcism) but the threshold won\u2019t be too high (still under consideration)\n+ No more hell \/ GoW: farm epics regular dungeons\n\n\n\nMore System Updates* Game\u2019s systems will be drastically changed to reduce reliance on raw damage and improve the ARPG aspect. Will happen across several patches to prevent too many changes happening at once.\n* Warlord and mind stimulant removed\/nerfed (will no longer be necessary in dungeons).\n* Improved TP effect for lower skills (skills below lvl 30): master\/max level readjusted, tp redistribution .\n\n* Readjusted defensive capabilities: Defensive abilities, max HP and armor \/ defense values will be rescaled, mobs will have much less I-frames. Will try to make defensive values and options on gears actually meaningful.\n* Incapacitation gauge: A new gauge will be added below mobs\u2019 HP bar to indicate their status effect immunity. Use appropriate attacks & deal with patterns to deplete the gauge and enter groggy or make the boss vulnerable to status effects.\n\n* Revamped status effects: Status effects like freezing and petrification will be changed, they'll stop the enemies on their track but not actually interrupt their pattern. Other changes are also in plan.\n* 3rd Awakening Skill Change: Too slow, they'll be reduced to about 3 seconds. Still thinking about what to do for a lotta stuff like animated cut-ins etc., plans might change in the future.\n  \n* Renewed Reinforcement \/ Amplification: This is a system unique to 100+ gears. They will have no failure penalty up to +12 reinforcement and +10 amp in exchange for slightly reduced chance and increased cost. Will also have a failsafe system to prevent being stuck at a certain level like +9 too many times.\n* Base Element Boost: Element Boost on passives (such as Soul Bender and Female Nen) will be replaced with skill damage.\n* Creatures: More dynamic participation in dungeons (creature skills) and artifacts renewal. Skills may be modifiable so that they can be more useful in dungeons. Artifacts will have new and meaningful effects.

So I used some of my alts and ran this dungeon to see what was all the fuss was about.\n\nHow Ghent Changed* Before the patch, your daily reward count was at 20 runs, and each run can early up about 280\u00a0. So literally you could finish all 12 Ghent Unique pieces in like 2 days of farming. On top of that, all the extra Token you got, you can buy heavy weapon from Lindsey for easy money. It was one of the best method to farm gold for new player.\n* After the patch, the daily reward count was changed to 6, and the amount of\u00a0\u00a0you can get per run was severely nerfed.\n\n* So I used 20 of my alts and ran Ghent Palace 120 times full clear on Expert mode with premium contract. I sold everything and also record what Unique dropped. There are 2 things I'm looking for:\n1. How much Token and gold can I get?\n2. If the Unique drop rate is increased, how long can I get all Ghent Unique pieces?\n\nData and Observation\n\n* Token and Gold\n+ From 20 alts, I got 5,411,818 gold. I also got 7,076 Tokens combining both untradable and account-bound versions. Using those will get me about 17 heavy weapons, which can be resold for 509,184 gold, which will earn me 5,921,002\n+ So in average, each time I do my daily 6 runs, I get about 296,050\u00a0.\n+ If you think about it, 6 runs give me about 300k, 20 runs would give about 986,833 gold. When you compare that to my previous analysis, you're not very far off. Granted this is a very small number of runs (120) compared to that data (400), but I'm sure the number won't be too far off.\n+ In conclusion, does Farming patch nerf Ghent as a gold farm place? Not really. However, it's a bit inconvenience that you have to farm it in multiple alts to rack up the Tokens. So for new players, it can be harder to get the gold if they only have 1 character. They can still farm Ghent after the 6 runs, they will just get less gold.\n\n* Character Progression\n+ Since we get much less Token now, our primary source will have to be from dungeon drops. In the 120 runs, I got 48 Uniques and 2 Epics. So yeah, 40% unique drop rate is not bad at all.\n+ Some observation about these Unique drops though. (1) You don't always get the weapon for your class. (2) Not sure if it was intended but the majority of armor drops seem to match the character's mastery. There was only 4 pieces that didn't match (e.g. Heavy Shoulder on Skirmisher).\n\nHow Long to Get 12 Unique Pieces?* It's hard to tell due to RNG. But let say I don't care about armor mastery, and I assumed all the above 20 alts are the same character and from using the above data:\n+ Day 1: I would have Top and Shoulder\n+ Day 2: I would have Ring\n+ Day 3: I would have duplicates\n+ Day 4: I would have Shoes and Magic Stone\n+ Day 5: I would have Bracelet\n+ Day 6: I would have duplicates\n+ Day 7: I would have duplicates again. So I would have given up and used 2,474 Total Token to buy the remaining pieces. If this character happens to be Brawler, I would have the weapon on day 1.\n\n* For new player who only have 1 character, it probably will take about 14 days to complete if you don't take drops into account. But if you count the drops, it will be much faster. But yeah, regardless, it will still be much slower than before the patch.\n\n\n\n","625":"\n\n* This small update adds Guide & Squad mode for Ozma raid along with Hard mode for Sirocco Raid.\n* Full details are located in\u00a0Neople official website.\n* Events\n+ A Melody for Adventurers\n+ Monster Colosseum Season 2\n+ Merry Christmas & Happy New Year\n+ Merry Epic Christmas!\n\n* Sales\n+ Snowman Avatar\n\nComments* A Melody for Adventurers\n+ The extra silver and gold notes are nice.

What were dropped? How much gold can you get?\n* Here I clear the dungeon 400 times to see how it's compared to Stormy Route.\n\nProcedure & Data* Roschest is tricky, instead of taking a fixed 8 FP per run like other level 100 dungeon, it takes 1 FP per room. On top of that, the FP required to clear Roschest depends on the mini-boss at room 4. You can follow this\u00a0Black Purgatory Daily Dungeons Simply Explained\u00a0for the optimal route of farming. In a nutshell, it can take anywhere from 9~11 FP to clear the dungeon.\n* Therefore, to be consistent, I decided to do full clear (12 FP). Below is the data for what I got with Neo-Premium without repair cost (each character represents 20 runs at Normal Mode).\n\n* And here's the data from previous Stormy Route runs from my previous post\u00a0Stormy Route: Sirocco \"Nerf\" Debunked. Same procedure, 20 runs, sell all drop, not include repair cost, etc. Jackpot means you encounter the demon dog thingy that drop a bunch of Time's Guide Stones.\n\nDiscussion* In term of raw gold: I used market price 25,999 for\u00a0\u00a0and 5,900 for\n+ Raw gold means what I got by selling all the drops and selling\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the auction hall.\n+ For Stormy Route, you average 1,048,788 gold per 20 runs (aka 6,555 gold per FP)\n+ For Roschest, you average 1,600,821 gold per 20 runs (aka 6,670 gold per FP)\n+ Note that this Roschest average is based on full run of 12 FP, and you earn about 1.75% more gold than Stormy Route, so if you follow the optimal route through the algorithm, I'm sure you can make even more.\n\n* In term of progression:\n+ For Stormy Route, you average 61\u00a0\u00a0per 20 runs (aka 0.38\u00a0\u00a0per FP)\n+ For Roschest, you average 27\u00a0\u00a0per 20 runs (aka 0.11\u00a0\u00a0per FP)\n+ So, if you want more hell mat to run Guide of Wisdom, Stormy Route is probably better place to farm. In return, you only earn just a little bit less gold.\nFinal Impression\n\n* Roschest Outskirts:\n+ Pros:\n- Drops tradable materials like\u00a0 which can easily funneled into another character. You will make more gold than Stormy Route if you sell these in the auction hall.\n- Drops a lot more\u00a0\u00a0than stormy route, which is one of the main complain from lots of players.\n- Drops Black Purgatory materials so you can roll your luck.\n- Drops epic if you're lucky.\n\n+ Cons:\n- Requires a lot more gear to farm effectively. My full Aeterna Berserker can farm Stormy easily. But when I bring him to Roschest, oh man, it wasn't good.\n\n* Stormy Route:\n+ Pros:\n- Drops more hell mats for Guide of Wisdom.\n- Drops a bit more gold, but you will end up making less if you sell all the Aiolites and Time Crystals from Roschest.\n- Doesn't require as much gear to clear.\n\n+ Cons:\n- Those hell mats are untradable, so hard to funnel to another alt.\n- Doesn't drop as much\u00a0, which pretty needed for everything in level 100. With Ozma raid on the horizon, you're gonna need even more.\n- Doesn't drop epic.\n\nWhich One I Farm* Neither, I don't farm 1 dungeon mindlessly with 1 character. I do my daily on multiple alts. Think about it, doing daily 4s on 5 alts is the same as doing 20 runs with 1 alt. Plus I get to enjoying playing variety of characters.

And it's organized bases on the release date of the contents.\n* Before we get started, I'll assume you already read the first addition\u00a0Level 100 Cap: Guide to Gear Progression\u00a0and you already start farming Legendary (5+5) and Epic dungeon (2+2).\n\nTable of Contents* 05\/2020 -\u00a0The Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection\n* 06\/2020 -\u00a0The Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum\n* 08\/2020 -\u00a0Dark Dimension: Signs of a Rift\n* 10\/2020 -\u00a0Sirocco Raid\n* 02\/2021 -\u00a0The Exile Mountains\n* 05\/2021 -\u00a0The Night of Revelation\n* 06\/2021 -\u00a0The Continent of Aeterna\n* 06\/2021 -\u00a0Sirocco Challenge Mode\n* 07\/2021 -\u00a0Black Purgatory\n* 09\/2021 - Grave Tower\n* 10\/2021 - Ozma Raid\n\n\n\nThe Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection* Released on May 2020, this is a 4-man dungeon added just right after level 100 cap was released. You can learn how to clear it from this\u00a0The Oculus: The Sanctum of Resurrection Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n* The whole point of this dungeon is to get gather enough material (Grim Seeker's Dark Soul) to get your Ditto epic piece. It's named after the Pokemon who can change to any other Pokemon.\n* As the name suggest, upon completing the quest, you can pick any epic piece you want. You can also change it to whatever as well, it would just cost some materials.\n* You can see which piece is the Ditto epic by the star indicator. As you can see, it's a huge help in progressing your character.\n\n* If you don't know which Ditto piece to pick, the Gear Calculator\u00a0has an option to include Ditto. Just pick that and let the program do the job for you. Note that you will need input enough pieces for this option to work.\n  \n\n\nThe Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum* Released in June 2020, this is a harder version of the regular Oculus.\u00a0You can learn how to clear it from this\u00a0The Oculus: The Abysmal Sanctum Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n* This content, in my opinion, doesn't really add much to your progression. Because if you're strong enough to do this hard mode, you're pretty much at the end-game already.\n* Most people do this for the epic weapon box\u00a0\u00a0and Product of Wisdom recipes\u00a0.\n+ The\u00a0\u00a0is account-bound so you can farm this on your top geared characters, then use it on your alt since you can choose class specific weapon.\n+ The\u00a0\u00a0can drop at low chance and can be sold for a very expensive price.\n\n\n\nDark Dimension: Signs of a Rift* Released in August 2020, this content has good intention. When upgraded all the way, it can be strong. Unfortunately, the farming time is quite long, and the effort required to get to that point doesn't not worth the trouble.\n* I have done an analysis about this and you can read about it in this\u00a0Dark Dimension: An Analysis of Upgraded Level 100 Legendary Equipment\n\n\nSirocco Raid* Released in October 2020, this is the next big major step in your progression.\n* The main goal of this raid is to get new epic pieces. It also has another Ditto option as well, but here you can only pick in the pull of Sirocco specific pieces.\n\n  \n* This raid adds 5 different sets of 3-pieces along with additional weapon upgrade. Each piece can be fused to your existing epic piece to give you more stat.\n\n  \n* Each set has their own strengths and weaknesses, and the drops are purely RNG. In the Korean server, they already have Sirocco Farming Improvement added. But in the meantime, it has not reached DFOG server.\n* Below is an example of my character having 3 Sirocco Rodos pieces fused to my Bottom, Ring, and Sub Equipment pieces. Unfortunately, I'm still missing the weapon upgrade.\n* The Epic Calculator again also has Sirocco option you can choose to see which one best fit for you.\n\n* You can read about how to do this raid in this\u00a0Sirocco: 7-stages Raid Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\nThe Exile Mountains* Released in February 2021, this is another upgrade to your character. Here instead of upgrading your actual epic pieces, you're upgrading your talisman. You can think of this content as the next version Pandemonium War.\n* The cutline is about Sirocco raid green party. So you don't have to completely grad Sirocco to do this content. This is intended to do side-by-side with Sirocco raid.\n* Here of course you upgrade your current P. War talisman to its Capella's Stigma version. You can also upgrade your runes as well from Rare to Unique tier.\n* Here's an example of my talisman. As you can see, I still need to upgrade my runes.\n* You can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Exile Mountains Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\n\nThe Night of Revelation* Released in May 2021, this is a side solo content of the Exile Mountain.\n* This content is not intended to progress your main character, but rather help you gear up your alts. Think of this as the upgraded version of Pandemonium Meeting.\n* I do this content to buy Prey Raid mat to upgrade level 95 gear to level 100 for my alts. You can also buy budget enchant beads as well. They provide similar stat to Sirocco raid enchants, just a bit weaker.\n* You can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Night of Revelation Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\nThe Continent of\u00a0Aeterna* Released in June 2021, this is another side content that is not intended to progress your main character. You do this content is mainly gear up your synergy characters.\n* In a nutshell, it adds 8 more epics set to level 100 cap that when used in while soloing, it will activate a set of stat. Then when used in a party of 2 or more, it activates another set of stat. This party stats provide huge synergy effects for everyone else but you (you basically a sandbag here).\n* When used appropriately, character that use Aeterna gear can get into end game contents such as Sirocco raid and later contents.\n* The best part about this content is can be easily funneled. So when farmed with enough alts, you can gear up character in no time.\n* You can read everything about this content in this\u00a0Aeterna\u00a0category. It includes guides about how to farm gear, which set to use, how many alts needed to farm, and why you should do this content event for DPS character.\n\n\nSirocco Challenge Mode* Released in June 2021 along with Aeterna, in my opinion, it doesn't really add much progression to your main character. Think of this like the Oculus Hard Mode. If you're strong enough to clear Sirocco Challenge Mode, you're already hit the class ceiling.\n* Really the main rewards from this mode are Chest of Immateriality, new Product of Wisdom, and a show-off aura.\n* Regardless, you can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Sirocco Challenge Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\nBlack Purgatory* Released in July 2021, this is another major upgrade to your character. This content provide 2 type of new materials.\n* Ore of Despair , which is used to change the modifier (via rolling) on the equipment slots that can be fused with Sirocco epic (i.e. Weapon, Bottom, Ring, Sub Equip). Each roll will take 165 Ore and 20k gold.\n\n* Fearsome Eye , which is used to maximize that modifier you rolled with Ore of Despair. Maxing each slot will require 13 eyes.\n\n* For example, I rolled the target option for my weapon of Additional Att. Damage. I can use the 13\u00a0\u00a0to max this modifier to 30% at guarantee success rate.\n\n* These stat that you rolled are independent of your sirocco piece's stat. So you can basically roll for whichever modifier you want that best fit your character's needs.\n* If you don't know which stat to roll for, again, the Epic Calculator also give you the recommended stats to roll for. It basically tries to equalize all the modifiers your sets provide so you can maximize your damage output.\n\n* Of course for this recommendation to work, make sure you select the Black Purgatory options in the calculator.\n\n* You can learn how to do this content in this\u00a0Black Purgatory Made Simple\u00a0guide.\n\n\n\nGrave Tower* Released on September 2021, this is another side content that doesn't really add much to your progression. Instead, it's designed to gear up your alts. This tower is extremely hard, so don't expect to get very far.\n* The idea is you send your strongest characters here to gather \"Old Golden Coin\" to buy stuff from the shop. Really the item you want to buy is the epic pot.\n* The great thing about this pot is that you can pick and choose which weapon type you want to buy. For example, if I want Zanbato on my Sword Master, I can just buy the Zanbato pot. Since there's only 2 level 100 epic Zanbato, I at least have 50% chance if getting the weapon I want.\n\n  \n\n\nOzma Raid* Released in October 2021, this raid is another big step to your progression.\n* The concept is similar to Sirocco raid, where you get new epic pieces to fuse to your existing gear. In Sirocco, you fuse with Weapon, Bottom, Ring, and Sub Equipment. In Ozma, you fuse with 5 more slots: Head\/Shoulder, Belt, Shoes, Necklace, Magic Stone.\n* Ozma raid also comes with its Ditto piece, but the major different is the Holy Grail of Faith system, where you can reroll your pieces while filtering out which pieces you don't want.\n* Below are some of great resources for this raid:\n+ Ozma Raid Made Simple\n+ Ozma of Chaos Raid for Dummy\n+ Ozma Raid Tips and Tricks\n+ Ozma Epics Made Simple\n\n  \nChangelog* 11\/21\/2021: Added Grave Tower and Ozma Raid\n\n\n","680":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2362\/Writings-of-the-Apostles?page=1  \n\n\n\n\n","681":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Knight classes.

If I can't grad Sirocco in 9 months, how long will Purgatory RNG take?\n* Luckily with the new farming improvement released in Korea server, you can possibly grad in about 3 months ... if you're whale enough.\n\nTable of contents* What is Purgatory Grad\n* For the Casual\n* For the Whales\n* For the GO ALL OUT\n* TLDR\n\n\n\nWhat is Purgatory Grad* In a nutshell, Black Purgatory provides 2 new materials:\n+ Ore of Despair\u00a0, which is used to change the modifier (via rolling) on the equipment slots that can be fused with Sirocco epic (i.e. Weapon, Bottom, Ring, Sub Equip). Each roll will take 165 Ore and 20k gold.\n+ Fearsome Eye\u00a0, which is used to maximize that modifier you rolled with Ore of Despair. Maxing each slot will require 13 eyes.\n\n+ For example, I rolled the target option for my weapon of Additional Att. Damage. I can use the 13\u00a0\u00a0to max this modifier to 30% at guarantee success rate.\n\n* Regardless of how many\u00a0\u00a0you have in your inventory, since you have 4 slots to RNG roll, you will need at least 52\u00a0\u00a0to max their stats.\n* So what does it take to get 52 Fearsome Eyes? Let's do some simple math.\n\n\n\nFor the Casual* Let's say you're the most casual player in the game. You don't farm any daily dungeons at all. The only thing you did is to do 2 Black Purgatory level 1 runs.\n* Let's also say you're has the worst RNG in the game, you will get 550\u00a0\u00a0per week (275x2) with no gold\u00a0\u00a0flips.\n+ Lucky for you, in the recent KDnF update, you can buy up to 2 Fearsome Eye boxes\u00a0\u00a0per week for a price of 630\u00a0\u00a0each.\n+ So with your casual earning of 550\u00a0, each week you can get 0.87\u00a0. Therefore, to graduate Black Purgatory as an extreme casual with worst RNG, it will take you about 60 weeks (aka 15 months).\n+ I'm still collecting data from daily dungeon runs. But so far, each daily normal runs of 4 dungeons gives you about extra 52\u00a0. So add that to your 550\u00a0\u00a0will get you about 1.45\u00a0\u00a0per week, which will translate to about 36 weeks (9 months) to grad.\n\n* Let's say you have the best RNG, you get 292\u00a0\u00a0and 1\u00a0\u00a0every level 1 run.\n+ 584\u00a0\u00a0will get you about 0.93\u00a0\u00a0per week from\u00a0, adding 2\u00a0\u00a0from your runs will translate to about 18 weeks (4.5 months).\n+ If you add the daily farming, that will bring down to about 15 weeks (3.75 months).\n\n* AND that doesn't take in account for the\u00a0\u00a0needed to roll for the modifier you want. I doubt many people can get it in 1 roll.\n\n\n\nFor the Whales* When the KDnF update hit live server, each box of 50\u00a0\u00a0was sold in the auction hall for about 1.2 million gold (sauce).\n\n* So really, you don't even have to run the content and just buy those boxes for your weekly 2\u00a0. Therefore, to get 52\u00a0, it will take you 26 weeks (6.5 months) of buying these boxes.\n* AND to buy 52\u00a0\u00a0(aka 32,760\u00a0), you will need to spend 786 million gold.\n* AND\u00a0(of course) that doesn't take in account for the\u00a0\u00a0needed to roll for the modifier you want.\n\n  \n\n\nFor the GO ALL OUT* What if you buy the\u00a0\u00a0and has the best RNG? what then...\n* Well, in this case I will assume you do level 4, because whale...\n* Both level 4 runs give 936\u00a0\u00a0and 2\u00a0. So you only need to spend 7.7 million gold to buy the remaining 324\u00a0\u00a0for the weekly\u00a0.\n* At this rate, you can grad in 13 weeks (3.25 months) and only need to spend about 25 million gold.\n* AND\u00a0(of course) that doesn't take in account for the\u00a0\u00a0needed to roll for the modifier you want.\n\n\n\nTL;DR* Casuals:\n+ Worst RNG + level 1 BP = 15 months\n+ Worst RNG + level 1\u00a0BP + Daily = 9 months\n+ Best RNG + level 1\u00a0BP = 4.5 months\n+ Best RNG + level 1\u00a0BP + Daily = 3.75 months\n\n* Whales:\n+ No BP + Gold only = 6.5 months &\u00a0786 million gold\n+ Best RNG + level 4 BP + Gold = 3.25 months & 25 million gold\n\n\n","685":"\n\n* On July 7, 2021 Japan server has released Knight 3rd Awakening\n* They also released the Summer package along with other events\n* Updates\n\n+ This update adds Knight 3A.\n+ Detail information are located in JDnF official website.\n\n* Sale\n+ Their Summer Package: Pretty much the same look we have in global server.

Here they follow the normal pattern like every other dungeon in DFO (i.e. 1 FP per room).\n* Below is the map of all 4 dungeons. As you can see, it will take 8 FP to rush to boss. Then they all have 4 extra rooms (highlighted in white).\n* The way these dungeons are designed is that there are specific mini-bosses and named champion in specific rooms.\n\nWhich Spawn Where* Beside the final boss, there are 3 other type that can spawn.\n* The Mini-boss: These ALWAYS spawns in the first intersection (room 4) of every map. They usually drop an Aiolite or Time Crystal.\n+ For Outskirts map, they are 3 possible spawns, and we will talk about it in a bit.\n+ For the other 3 maps, these mini-bosses are the Followers of the Dark Knights.\n\n* The Intruder: From what I've seen, these spawns about 2 rooms before the boss.\n+ If you have played the real Black Purgatory dungeon, these are the boss guarding the crossroad (Jade, Onyx, Venta).\n+ Killing these will drop a handful (~10)\u00a0\u00a0and possibly\u00a0.\n* The Fresh Blood (aka Chanpion monsters): These are the one that have the green name above them.\n+ They only spawn in the \"extra\" rooms randomly (aka the one highlighted in white).\n+ They drop handful of Aiolites and Time Crystals (really anywhere from 1~10 if not more). These will be your main source of income while farming.\n  \nHow to Farm Effectively* I'll run some number in future post to compare between them and stormy.\n* Anyway, beside doing your normal daily clears for the special gold card flips, Outskirts of Roschest will be the best place for you to farm on, for a few reasons:\n+ The bosses there are a lot easier to kill, their patterns are not as pain in the ass.\n+ It's the only dungeon where you can predict the location the mini-boss, intruder, and the fresh blood, therefore you can spent FP more efficiently.\n\n* When you're at the first intersection (room 4), the boss you fighter there will determine the possible location of other Fresh Blood and whether you will have an Intruder.\n+ In the explanation below, the marked rooms are possible locations of Fresh Blood mob. The Red Mark is the direct indicator of Intruder present.\n\n  \n* If Onyx Black: Proceed downward!\n+ If you see a Fresh Blood in the Red Mark\u00a0room, that mean you're guarantee to have an Intruder. So kill the Fresh Blood for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0.\u00a0Then go back and rush to boss, killing the Intruder on the way and get your extra\u00a0.\n+ If you DON'T see a Fresh Blood in the\u00a0Red Mark\u00a0room, that mean you won't have an Intruder (bummer). The next location of Fresh Blood will be one room over (Green Mark). So go there for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0,\u00a0then\u00a0go back and rush to boss.\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n* If Venta: Proceed straight! forward the Orange Mark.\n+ That's the only place you will find Fresh Blood. There's no indicator of whether you get Intruder. So clear for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0\u00a0and rush to boss.\n\n* .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\nIf Jade: Proceed straight! to Green Mark instead of going down to Red Mark. Why?\n+ If you go to Red Mark first and you don't see a a Fresh Blood (wasted 1 FP), you will need go to next room Green Mark. Whereas if you find a Fresh Blood right at Green Mark, you can just back track and rush to boss.\n+ So when you get to the Green Mark and nothing there, go to Red Mark, kill the Fresh Blood for your batch of\u00a0\u00a0\/\u00a0.\u00a0Then go back and rush to boss, killing the Intruder on the way and get your extra\u00a0.\n\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n  \nReferenceshttp:\/\/df.nexon.com\/df\/cast\/article\/MDU1NTMhttps:\/\/blog.naver.com\/win4778\/222243060566\n\n","687":"\n\n* In order to keep this article short and sweet, I will assume you already know what Arad Pass works and what the general rewards are.\n* In case you still don't know what this is, DFOG already has a version of it here Arad Pass Season 1.

To celebrate this class, new Arad Pass was added exclusively just for her. Here I summarize what are in this package.\n\n* This pass is very similar to the Arad Pass we already know. You pick your Blade as the character, then you do daily, weekly, seasonally mission to level up your pass level and get rewards.\n\nBlade Exclusive Benefit* So why would you want to buy this pass and not the regular Arad Pass? From what I see, this gives you exclusive Blade avatar with a hood just like her concept art AND a pet that's her dog. There you go, the whole concept art collection.\n* Below is what the avatar look like, I dig it. Now only if it also comes in different color.\n\n* And here's her pet and its skills\n\n* The pet's stat is pretty good. Gives you +1 level of 2A passive and +18% critical damage.\n\n  \nRewards By Levels* The rewards are pretty good. You can see these rewards in details in this\u00a0supplementary\u00a0page (they are quick google translate and pretty self explanatory)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nReferenceshttp:\/\/df.nexon.com\/df\/pg\/bladepass2021  \n\n\n","695":"\n\n* With the release of summer package 2021, we now have a new title that everyone has been talking about.\n* Here I'll explain why it's unique and why it's extremely popular, even in Korea.\n\nHow It Work* When you get the package, opening the title box will give you 1 of 45 different titles.\n\n* The pool is 45 title because you get a chance of getting 2 type of titles, Normal and Platinum (5 of each kind).\n* Of the Platinum title, it's further split into 8 titles (each giving damage to a particular skill ranging from level 30 to level 80). So 8 times 5 is 40, plus 5 normal title, give 45 titles.\n\nWhy It Special* 15% damage modifier is nothing special for DFO global, but it's the additional damage to skill level is what make it unique. This is the first time we have had this in global version.\n* This type of title is nothing new in Korea. They have had this for multiple packages, and it's one of the most popular title there. If you look at player ranking in\u00a0Dunfaoff, pretty everyone there has this title.\n* So why is it so popular? well, the current meta is more doing sustain damage with Black Purgatory and Ozma raid. So many players are switching to those type of build, which include more Cool Down Reduction (CDR) gears. Adding to the list is talisman, which many of them further increase damage for those skills.\n* There you can see, Talisman + CDR gear such as Crossroad set + This title = OP gear.\n\nHow to Get It* If you look at the stat for all title, the best one is \"A Midsummer Night Dream\" due to the 15% modifier. You can RNG reroll this title for the one you want with \"Title Change Ticket\" for 500,000 gold each.\n* Another way to guarantee getting the title with the skill damage you want is through the coin shop.\n* For 4 coins, you can upgrade any title into \"A Midsummer Night's Dream title\". Then for another 4 coins, you can upgrade that title into the Platinum version that has a random skill option.\n* Then you can RNG reroll this Platinum title for the skill you want for 2 coin each.\n\n* Really if you think about it, it will take at least 10 coins to get the Platinum you want, and you may need to reroll more for the skill. So Neople put another option in this coin shop.\n* For 10 coins, you can buy the \"A Midsummer Day Title Box\", which basically A Midsummer Night's Dream Platinum version (aka best version title) AND you get to select which skill you want on that too.\n\nWhich Skill to Pick* One of our player with explorer club \"Dream\" has kindly compiled a comprehensive popularity list for every class in the game using\u00a0Dunfaoff\u00a0ranking system (basically going into people profile and see which level title they use).\n* You can see that list in this\u00a0BiS Skill Boosting Title For Each Class\u00a0Excel Sheet. Of course, only use this as reference and don't follow it blindly.\nShould I Buy This Title* Our official DFOG Content Creator, Yong\\*, has created a great flow chart just to answer this question. It also compares this title with previous ones we had.\n* In a nutshell, this title is pretty much for min-maxing your character. Below is an example from KDnF player showing the damage increase.\n* In the picture below, both titles give the same 15% modifier, but the one on the left give 10% damage to level 45 skill. This player is a Female Ranger, which level 45 skill\u00a0(Death Hawk) is extremely popular. This player concluded that the damage increase was only about 2.5%.\n\nReferenceshttps:\/\/m.blog.naver.com\/tjehdrms0908\/222038684051Reddit -\u00a0Yong\\*'s \"Should I Buy This Title\" Flow Chart  \n\u00a0Excel -\u00a0BiS skill boosting title for each class  \n\n\n","696":"\n  \nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2301\/Bullets-Defender-of-the-Skies?page=1  \n\n\n","697":"\n\n* We all know that Aeterna is all about synergy gear. We all hear people say \"Aeterna is only good for synergy character\". But did you know these epics are actually really good for soloing play?\n* Here I'll quickly show you how strong these epics are and why you should do this content. Playing as a NOOB berzerker.\n\n\n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }  \nWhat Gear?* Really this character is super barebone. I ran Bee set on him, and in case you don't know, all Aeterna sets when solo will have the same stat.\n* I got nothing on him. No enchants, aura, avatar, talisman, pet, insignia. No gear retexture. NOT even swap set. NOTHING.\n* The only thing I got is +6 refinement on the weapon.\n\n* With this gear, I was able to clear Black Shrine in about 1m15s with 48% Crit Chance.\n\nShould You Do Aeterna?* 1,000% yes, even if you're playing a DPS character. This content provide a much much much faster progression to your character with very little investment.\n* If you're one of those alterholic player, this is great to gear up your dead alts. Farming with enough alts can get you full 11\/11 Aeterna epic in a week.\n* Take that in contrast with trying to clear 2+2 with full legendary gear. Full legendary will take you anywhere from 2.5~3 weeks of daily 5+5.

It was quickly abused and patched up with an Emergency Maintenance.\n* This article explain the situation and hopefully it can be avoided in future events.\n\nWhat is the Event* You can read the full event page here. But in the nutshell, this is a leveling event where you can pick any character and potentially level it up to max 100 in a very short amount of time.\n* This type of event uses a special type of dungeon, where you can fly through everything and level up very quickly.\n\n* The one item that was being abused was the weapon. When your event character hit level 95, they give you a selective level 100 epic weapon that has +12 reinforcement \/ +8 refined.\n\nHow It Was Abused* Before the Emergency Patch, the weapon from this box can actually be transferred to another character using NPC Magar Rosenbach, and you can select event character over and over.\n* So what happened was players was using this weapon to attempt +13 reinforcement. If it success, they would transfer it to their main. If fail, they would delete that event character and choose another character in the account as event character. The process is then repeat over and over.\n\n  \nRespond from Neople* The problem was quickly brought up to the developer and it was quickly patch\n  \n* Personally, from my point of view, this was definitely not a bug, but rather just an oversight. It was possibly a simple human error. Regardless, I thought they did a great job at addressing the problem in such a short amount of time.\n\n\n","699":"\n\n+ This update adds 3rd awakening for all Female Gunner classes.

Looks like they kind of speed up the pathing process because in Korea, BP modes are added about 2 weeks after Lancer 3A.\n* They also added the Adventure Reputation, which was added in Korea with the\u00a0Ozma Raid\u00a0release back in May.\n\n* Sirocco Farming QoL has also been added. More detail on this QoL from the KDnF Patch here.\n\n* They also adds Aeterna option for sader classes as well.\nEvents* Lancer 3A, generic event, but they also give a box that give a random lancer weapon.

It give you skill cut-in, party frame, and slime twin creature box.\n\n  \n  \n* Amazing box, nothing special really\n+ gives you 1,500 Time's Guide Stone and a 156 FP pot.\n+ gives you decent beads.\n- Sub Equip: All stat + 80\n- Sub Equip: PMI + 70\n- Magic Stone: All stat +60\n- Magic Stone: All Ele + 20\n- Earring: All stat +125\n\n* Guide \/ Squad Supporters, basically give you more reward when you do guide and squad mode.\n\n* Mileage Shop, interestingly they add new emotes for 500 mileage.\n\n  \nReferenceshttps:\/\/arad.nexon.co.jp\/news\/update\\_view.aspx?no=12281\n\n","703":"\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting Area\ndnfaos\\_town.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nHero's Warfront\ndnfaos\\_ready.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n\n\n\nCombat\ndnfaos\\_battle.ogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .HTML\\_Audio\\_player { z-index:10; \n background: linear-gradient(135deg,#2a2a2b 0,#2a2a2b 49%,#2a2a2b 49%,#444547 100%); \n color: inherit; \n min-height:120px; max-height:120px; \n display:flex;\n box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 3px 6px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23) 0px 3px 6px; \n flex-direction:row;padding: 20px 10px 20px;} \n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image { width:170px; display: flex; justify-content: center; } \n .player-content { \n flex-grow:1; \n display:flex; \n flex-direction:column;}\n \n .player-info { \n flex-grow:1; display:flex; \n flex-direction:column; \n justify-content:center; \n padding-left:10px;} \n \n .song-name { font-size:18px; font-weight:600; } .k2\\_audio\\_player { display:flex;} \n \n audio { flex-grow:1; height:60px; } \n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {\n background-color: #cccccc;\n border-radius: 50%;}\n\n audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button:hover {\n background-color: rgba(177,212,224, .7);}\n \n audio::-webkit-media-controls-panel {\n background: #e9e8f2;}\n \n .Audio\\_Player\\_image img:hover{animation:rotating 3s linear infinite} @keyframes rotating{from{transform:rotate(0deg)}to{transform:rotate(360deg)}}\n \n\n","704":"\n\n* This week updates doesn't add new content really. But instead, it adds UI improvement for the chatting system. Here are the highlights.\n* Problem:\u00a0The current chat window is not freely adjustable in placement and size.\n+ Solution:\u00a0You can adjust the size of the chat window, insane size.\n\n+ The chat window can be moved separately from the megaphone window.\n\n+ The default size of the megaphone window is changed from 4 lines to 3 lines.\n\n* Problem:\u00a0The conversation filter in the chat window was inconvenient to operate and the setting state was not saved properly.\n+ Solution: The ability to turn off filters in the System tab at once is added. You don't have to click each one individually.\n\n+ When you're using external chat, you can now hide the \"system\" chat.\n\n* Problem:\u00a0Dungeon & Fighter does not have many ways to communicate between adventurers in the game.\n+ Solution: Channel chat added.\u00a0You can talk to people on the same channel. I guess now you don't have to be in the same map area to see other people chat.\n+ If you chat more than 10 times in a row at intervals of 3 seconds or less, you cannot use the chat for 30 seconds. I suppose this is a way to reduce spam.\n+ You can use the channel chat directly through the shortcut key (\/c).\n+ New\/returning users are displayed in green, and cannot set a separate color change.\n\n* Problem:\u00a0Due to the nature of the game, where character changes are frequent, guild conversations are often cut off in the middle, making it difficult to communicate with guild members.\n+ Solution:\u00a0You can view the last 20 guild conversations when you log in.\n\n* BONUS: The new \"fade\" option is added for megaphone chat and regular chat.\n+ Since you can freely move them around, you can actually overlap the megaphone\u00a0chat onto your regular chat, then set the echo chat to \"fade\".\n+ In the example below, this player resize megaphone\u00a0to the smallest possible, then overlap, then fade. Now you will never have to see megaphone\u00a0ever again.

Be sure to check back on this guide for any edit made in the future.\n\nTable of Contents* Basic Concepts\n* Some Housekeeping Stuffs\n* Building Related Information\n+ Seria's Tree\n+ Remedial Basilica\n+ Bakery\n+ Adventurer's Guild Office\n+ Linus' Forge\n+ Sharan's Wizard Guild\n+ Loton's Alchemy Shop\n+ Danjin's Jar Shop\n\n* Adventurer Related Information\n+ Which Attribute to Invest\n+ What about Critical?\n\n* Tips and Tricks\n* References\n\n\nBasic Concepts* In the beginning, you start with Seria's Tree. This is basically your main command center. The higher level you upgrade, the more buildings are unlocked. Note that you will start out with only a portion of the map as buildable, you will have to upgrade Seria's Tree to uncover more building spaces.\n* You will start with 4 Adventures, and you can send them to various missions so you can earn rewards and upgrade your building. The more building you have, the more adventures you can recruit.\n\n\n\nSome Housekeeping Stuffs* The game shuts down when you move channel: Unlike Arad Adventure, you will need to open the game up and start it every time you move channel. The good news is that the game will still run when you switch characters.\n* When you remove a building, you DON'T get a refund: This is crucially important because gold is tight in the early game. Most people will just build like the picture below.\n\n* When placing a building, only when the road is connected, guests can visit:\n+ There are 11 building, and this only apply to the ones that sell stuff (e.g. Bakery, Dress Room, Market). So pay attention to the description.\n+ You can build additional path to make sure guest can come in.\n\n* Roads provided by default cannot be removed: The highlighted stone paths are provide by default, so use them to place your building.\n\n\n\nBuilding Related Information* Most of your building can be found in the construction tab. Higher level building will require Soul as well (I'll show you how to get them later).\n\n\n\nSeria's Tree* Just like when you run dungeon, your adventures inside this mini-world also consume FP while they're on exhibitions.\u00a0 Adventures will consume 1 FP for each monster they defeat. Consume 4 FP if they die.\n* The higher level Seria's Tree is, the faster your adventures can recover FP.\n+ Level 1: Recovers 1 fatigue every 50 seconds (total recovery = 2 hours and 10 minutes)\n+ Level 5: Recover 1 fatigue every 46 seconds (total recovery = 2 hours)\n+ Level 10: Recovery 1 fatigue every 41 seconds (total recovery = 1 hour 47 minutes)\n+ Level 15: Recovery 1 fatigue every 36 seconds (total recovery = 1 hour 34 minutes)\n\n\n\nRemedial Basilica* When an Adventure dies, they go here. Higher level will revive them faster.\n+ Level 1: 90 seconds to full recovery\n+ Level 15: 20 seconds to full recovery\n\n\n\nBakery* This is a place where you craft stuffs to sell to customer that walked in for coins. The basic one is bread.\n\n\n\nAdventurer's Guild Office* This is the most important building for mid-late game. This is your ONLY source of SOUL.\n* Think of this like a place where you send out hit-list for your adventures. You can send out up to 4 adventures to hunt down those hit-list. As you can see, the higher level these hit-list are, the more gold and higher tier souls you can get.\n\n\n\nLinus' Forge* This is where you can make weapon and other equipment to make your adventures stronger. Higher equipment will require higher tier souls.\n\n\n\nSharan's Wizard Guild* Just like \"Linus' Forge\" where you get your weapon and armor, in Sharan place, you can craft your accessory.\n\n\n\nLoton's Alchemy Shop* You can craft potion here to help your Adventures survive longer. They will be consume automatically.\n\n\nDanjin's Jar Shop* Of course, what is a mini-game that doesn't have RNG gacha machine? Here you basically break pots for a chance of strong equipment.\n\n\nAdventurer Related Information* You start out with 4 adventures and you get more as you place more building. Each adventure will have 4 equipment slots, and you unlock them as you level up.\n* Just like all the old school MMORPG, each level up you get attribute point to put them into 4 possible places: Attack, Defense, Health, and Crit. You can reset attribute as well, it would just cost a bunch of coins.\n\n\n\nWhich Attribute to Invest* Below is the comparison between Attack (Blue), Defense (Red), and Health (Gray), compiled by the KDnF community. The x-axis is the number of point invested for each stat. The y-axis is the amount of hit needed to kill a mob or the amount of hit needed to kill the adventure. (See EDIT at the bottom for further recommendation)\n\n* As you can see, whichever curve is the\u00a0stiffest is the one you should invest in. I'll give you some examples.\n* Example 1:\u00a0If you invest 12 points in defense based on adventurer level 21, you need to hit 22 times to kill the adventurer, and you need 2 points to increase one.\n\n* Example 2:\u00a0At level 31 adventurer, if you invest 11 points in attack power, you need to hit 8 times to kill a mob, and 3 points are required to reduce 1. As you can see, investing on attack power is not as efficient as Defense.\n\n* Example 3:\u00a0If you invest 16 points of HP based on Adventurer level 41, you need to hit 24 times to kill the Adventurer, and you need 3 points to add 1 more. Again, still not as efficient as Defense.\n\n* So here're the TLDR:\n+ Attack Power: Efficiency is high in the beginning, but decreases with investment.\n+ Defense: Low efficiency at the beginning, but increases with investment.\n+ Health: Shows a certain efficiency, but falls short compared to defense.\n\n\n\nWhat about Critical?* KDnF has a chart for that too. Here are the comparison between Attack (Blue) vs. Critical (Orange). The x-axis is the number of point invested for each stat. The y-axis is the calculated attack power. Here they assume that 1% attack is the same as 1% critical.\n* As you can see, there's a huge gap between the two. Unless you can equip that much attack power from epic tier items, it doesn't worth putting point on Critical.\n\n\n\nTips and Tricks* Building:\n+ Those building that sell items (e.g. bakery), the entrance of the building must face the path so customers can come in and buy things.\n+ The blacksmith & guild office doesn't sell anything, so they don't have to face the path.\n+ It is recommended to upgrade the building in the order of Tree \u2192 Guild Office \u2192\u00a0Blacksmith. (Higher level Tree = higher fatigue recovery speed up per hour, Higher level Guild Office = more Soul farming required for building upgrade, Higher Blacksmith = Making higher items necessary for hunting)\n\n* Making Coin:\n+ In the beginning, they give you a free bakery, so you just have to send the characters to the goblin hunting grounds, farm the ingredients, and make and sell bread. (25 coins each)\n+ There're also Market and Dress Room as well, so use those to make coin the same way as bread. (Market 40 coins each, Dressing room 60 coins each)\n\n* Mob Stat:\n+ Goblin: HP 420, Attack 80, Defense 50\n+ Tau: HP 2600, Attack 140, Defense 50\n+ Bigfoot: HP 3700, Attack 184, Defense 50\n+ Walker: HP 5200, Attack 238, Defense 50\n+ Kashipa: HP 6500, Attack 323, Defense 50\n+ Auca: HP 7700, Attack 373, Defense 50\n\nEDIT 9\/3\/2021* Another strategy that claimed to work well is the \"Glass Canon\". It basically says that end game subjugation like Isys and above have so much damage that it's better just dump all your point into Attack. As long as your adventure can do 1 hit, that's all that worth it. The reddit threads are:\n+ [Arcade Fighter Online] Sirocco Cleared\n+ Week 2 of AFO...Belfast is oof.\n\n* I was interested and reset 4 of my adventures who were level 83, 71, 70, and 69, who were struggling to clear Luke subjugation. It costed be about 150k coins or so and I changed them all to attack. Their gears and stat as follow. Blow in the hole, it seemed to work quite well.\n* If you're a player who do all Defense like me right at the beginning, I don't think you wasted your time and coin. I thought the leveling process with Defense went well. It's only the Subjugation part that didn't pay off.\n\nEDIT 9\/17\/21* I was finally able to defeat Sirocco in subjugation. Below is the proof and my characters stats along with my main building levels.\n\n* What make Sirocco hard is that she does AoE damage and she heals 1,000 HP every few second. What I did to defeat her is basically keep sending adventures over and over. I swapped all my adventures from Defense to Attack.\n* As you can see, after defeating Sirocco, 8 adventures were out of FP, and 8 adventures were at about half FP. So make sure you have enough adventures that are at high enough level before you face Sirocco.\n\n\nReferences[\ud301] \ube44\ud2b8 \uc564 \ud30c\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4\ubaa8\uc74c  \n[\ud301] Bit & Fighter \ud301 \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4! \uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788 \uc368\ubd24\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4  \n\ub358\ud30c] \ube44\ud2b8\uc564\ud30c\uc774\ud130 \uac74\ubb3c \ubcc0\uc2e0(\ucf54\uc2a4\ud2ac) \/ \uc2dc\ub85c\ucf54 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4  \n[\uc815\ubcf4] \uc0e4\ub780\uc758 \ub9c8\ubc95\uc0ac \uae38\ub4dc 10\ub819\uc815\ubcf4  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rgmwur3CVgY  \n\n\n","706":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2411\/Epic-Rental-Service?page=1\n\n","707":"\nhttps:\/\/www.dfoneople.com\/news\/events\/2410\/Spears-of-Piercing-Destiny?page=1\n\n","708":"\n\n* This update adds 3rd awakening for all Lancer classes.
